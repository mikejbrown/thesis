Things I want to do:

- [x] Acknowledgements
- [ ] Shorten the abstract
- [ ] Shorten the electroweak baryogenesis section
- [ ] Chapter start/finish flow editing
- [ ] Add references throughout
- [ ] Double check and update all references
- [ ] Tidy Mathematica notebooks
- [ ] Convert remaining renormalisations to generic scheme
- [ ] Double check all spelling/grammar
- [x] Add README.md
- [x] Add LICENCE
- [x] Add TODO.md
- [x] Smudge/clean filter for git tagging builds
    - ended up using a manual version file, with the build scripts running `git describe > version`
- [ ] Stats file to csv? Script???
- [x] Add .gitignore for thesis folder ready for splitting the repo
- [ ] Split thesis repo (add anything else needed before split?)
- [x] FIX build_arxiv_dist.sh script to replace `\bibliography{refs}` with contents of the .bbl file in the thesis_main.tex output for arXiv.
