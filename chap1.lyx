There has been remarkable progress in physics in the last century.
 The revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics in the first quarter
 of the 20th century led inevitably to the establishment of what is now
 known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the standard model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (SM) – the mathematical formulation of the laws of nature at the most fundament
al level currently known.
 This model successfully explains phenomena on scales ranging from a few
 thousands of a proton radius

For the cognoscenti: I am including classical general relativity with a
 cosmological constant in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

standard model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for rhetorical purposes.
 This does not exactly match standard particle physics usage of the term
 though, despite the famous difficulties of quantum gravity, it is consistent
 to include general relativity as a low energy effective field theory (see,
 e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

).
 The cosmological model is taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

CDM, i.e.
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dark
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 components of the universe are a cosmological constant and cold dark matter.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The outstanding puzzles where the standard model is known to fall short
 can be grouped into roughly three areas: questions about the character
 of the model itself which, although consistent, is arguably peculiar (e.g.
 the various fine tuning and hierarchy problems); questions about the behaviour
 of matter at extremely high energies which are mainly relevant to the early
 universe (e.q.
 questions about quantum gravity and the origin of matter); and questions
 about the behaviour of particles that may be abundant today, but are very
 weakly interacting with ordinary matter (neutrinos and dark matter).
 All of these questions are far removed from ordinary experience.
 The general consensus is that in the (limited) sense of knowing the underlying
 laws, all ordinary phenomena from atoms to solar systems are completely
 understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This statement should be incredible to anyone without a physics education,
 but it can be quickly supported by reading the published literature on
 fundamental physics (as conveniently summarised in, e.g., the annual Review
 of Particle Physics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) or by trawling the daily postings on the physics arXiv

: the research topics of interest to modern theoretical physicists lie very
 far from everyday experience.
 Physics students are taught to identify the relevant scales of length,
 time and energy in a problem and use the set of laws appropriate for that
 scale.
 However, they are also taught that this procedure is purely one of convenience,
 and that the laws governing phenomena at one scale can always be connected
 to the laws at neighbouring scales so that, for example, the laws of chemistry
 can be derived from the laws governing atoms which can in turn be derived
 from the laws governing sub-atomic particles and so on.
 In the language of particle physics and statistical mechanics this intuitive
 idea has been refined into the technically precise notion of effective
 field theories: a mathematical framework that allows one to mechanically
 derive the laws governing phenomena at larger distance scales from those
 governing smaller distance scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some embarrassing omissions in this tidy picture, however, all
 of which have to do with the 
\emph on
inability to calculate in practice what is calculable in principle
\emph default
.
 For instance, it is extremely difficult to compute, from the basic quantum
 mechanics of atoms, how a given protein molecule (consisting of many atoms)
 will fold into a biologically significant three dimensional shape.
 More relevant to this thesis, it is difficult to connect the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 theory of the standard model of sub-nuclear quarks and gluons (which are
 strongly interacting) with the very different looking effective theory
 of protons, neutrons and various mesons that is valid at nuclear scales.
 Similarly, it is difficult to accurately predict the behaviour of the Higgs
 field in the early universe which is filled with a very hot and dense plasma
 of many particles which may also be strongly interacting.
 In all cases the difficulty of the problem comes from the importance of
 a large number of degrees of freedom, or a strong coupling between degrees
 of freedom, or both.
 Only in the case of very simple systems or systems close to thermal equilibrium
 can their properties be determined with confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This inability to compute is not simply a philosophical difficulty for those
 seeking to shore up a reductionistic world-view.
 Neither is it simply a practical difficulty for those pure theoreticians
 who only want to better understand their mathematical models.
 It can also hinder efforts to learn real physics.
 For example consider the scenario of 
\emph on
electroweak baryogenesis
\emph default
, which is discussed in detail in the next section as a motivating physical
 example, though the methods discussed in the remainder of the thesis are
 broadly applicable.
 Briefly, it is believed that the Higgs field undergoes a phase transition
 at high temperatures which were reached in the early universe.
 The nature of this phase transition (e.g.
 whether it was first or second order, how much was the latent heat etc.)
 can have a profound impact on the amount of matter surviving to the present
 day universe.
 Hence, cosmological observations of the matter (baryon) density, as well
 as gravitational waves and primordial magnetic fields, have the potential
 to constrain this phase transition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is difficult to reliably tell whether a given particle physics
 model has a phase transition with given properties.
 For example, it is known that the standard model possesses a second order
 phase transition, but this finding was the result of a focused effort and
 could only be established using an expensive computational method (lattice
 Monte Carlo; see, e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DOnofrio2014"

\end_inset

).
 It is practically impossible to scan the parameters of a theory of beyond
 standard model (BSM) physics using this method.
 In the BSM context one largely has to make do with a patchwork of semi-empirica
l curve fitting methods to connect the small scale physics (the fundamental
 parameters of the BSM model) with the large scale physics (phase transition
 thermodynamics and baryon yield).
 All of these methods require approximations which are somewhat suspect.
 Thus, such cosmological observations are of limited usefulness for fundamental
 physics.
 New methods of calculation are required to bridge the gap between theory
 and experiment in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard model and the various BSM models are all examples of 
\emph on
quantum field theories
\emph default
 (QFTs).
 Quantum field theory is the mathematical language of nature.
 Viewed in this light, much of the last century of theoretical physics can
 be seen as quantum field theory calculations performed in a variety of
 approximations.
 The most fruitful scheme so far is clearly perturbation theory in small
 couplings, which has seen wide use and great success.
 The classic example of a successful perturbation theory is the theory of
 quantum electrodynamics (QED): the quantum field theory of electrons and
 photons.
 In this theory the small parameter is the electric charge 
\begin_inset Formula $e\approx0.3$
\end_inset

 of the electron, and observables are computed in a series expansion in
 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}+a_{1}e+a_{2}e^{2}+a_{3}e^{3}+\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the anomalous magnetic moment 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{e}$
\end_inset

 of the electron has been computed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{10}\right)$
\end_inset

 with the result being in fantastic agreement with experiment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

:

\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the numbers in parenthesis represent the uncertainties in the last
 digits (the theoretical prediction has uncertainties coming from several
 sources).
 These high order computations are typically laborious.
 For instance, the contribution of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aoyama2015"

\end_inset

 was to recompute a subset of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{10}\right)$
\end_inset

 terms with greater accuracy using Monte Carlo integration, which took 65
 days on a 128 core computer cluster.
 Perturbation theory is widely useful in practice despite the difficulty
 of improving its accuracy to high orders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are important physical situations where naive perturbation
 theory fails.
 Electroweak baryogenesis is discussed in the next section as a concrete
 example of a real physics proposal where perturbation theory breaks down
 in several important steps of the computation.
 In such cases perturbation theory must be enhanced by resummation if it
 can be used at all.
 Resummation works by re-organising the terms of the perturbation series
 so that each term of the resummed series contains contributions from all
 orders of the original series.
 This re-organisation can manifest qualitatively important physical effects
 which are invisible to the original perturbation theory.
 For example, massless particles in thermal plasmas produce large loop correctio
ns which must be resummed, causing thermal mass generation and non-analyticities
 in thermodynamic functions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kapusta2006"

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, large logarithms can invalidate naive perturbation theory in
 problems involving disparate length or energy scales.
 Resummation of these logarithms leads to the renormalisation group running
 of coupling constants

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the need to go beyond naive perturbation theory is clear in many
 cases, 
\emph on
ad hoc
\emph default
 resummations are problematic because perturbation series are asymptotic
 in nature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and the re-organisation of the terms of an asymptotic series is mathematically
 questionable at best

 Systematic resummation schemes are required to guarantee consistency with

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs are a set of techniques (one for each 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1,2,3,\cdots$
\end_inset

) which can be thought of as generalisations of mean field theory which
 are (a) elegant, (b) general, (c) in principle exact, and (d) have been
 promoted for their applicability to non-equilibrium situations (see, e.g.,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Berges2015"

\end_inset

 and references therein for extensive discussion of all these points).
 Non-perturbative methods are essential in non-equilibrium QFT because secular
 terms (i.e.
 terms which grow without bound over time) in the time evolution equations
 invalidate perturbation theory.
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs with 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$
\end_inset

 achieve the required non-perturbative resummation in a manifestly self-consiste
nt way which can be derived from first principles.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In principle exact
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here means that the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA equations of motion are exactly equivalent to the original non-perturbative
 definition of the quantum field theory.
 The only necessary approximation is in the numerical solution of these
 equations.
 The resulting equations of motion are also useful in equilibrium because
 many-body effects are included self-consistently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

General
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the methods are applicable in principle to any quantum field
 theory whatsoever (although in a theory with many fields or with large
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the resulting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA could be very bulky).
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elegant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here means that few conceptually new elements are needed in the formulation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs in addition to the usual terms of textbook quantum field theory.
 The complication is mainly of a technical, not conceptual, nature.
 To the author's knowledge no other techniques satisfy all of these criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These properties make the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs compelling candidates for filling the gap between theory and experiment
 anywhere the problem is the inability to compute the behaviour of strongly
 interacting degrees of freedom or degrees of freedom which are out of thermal
 equilibrium.
 As such, they form the basis of this thesis.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 of this thesis reviews 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs and then shows, in novel work, how they achieve a re-organisation
 of perturbation theory which is competitive with or exceeding more traditional
 resummation methods (using the 2PIEA and a toy model where exact results
 are available for the comparison).
 This success is explained in terms of the sensitivity of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA to analytic features of the exact solution which are invisible to perturbat
ion theory.
 The remainder of the thesis focuses on one of the major shortcomings of
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs – their poor handling of symmetries – and efforts to overcome it.

 The symmetry group of a model determines what types (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

representations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of particles may appear, as well as governing the form of the interactions
 and the conservation laws of the model.
 In the simplest case symmetries are 
\emph on
global
\emph default
, i.e.
 the same symmetry transformation applies everywhere in spacetime.
 In more complicated theories such as the standard model the symmetries
 are 
\emph on
gauge symmetries
\emph default
, meaning that independent symmetry transformations can be applied at each
 event in spacetime without altering the physics.
 The most important situation phenomenologically is the case of 
\emph on
spontaneously broken continuous symmetries
\emph default
.
 In this case the symmetry is not actually broken, merely hidden because
 there is an interaction which causes a ground state which behaves non-trivially
 under the symmetry to be energetically preferred.
 The classic example is the ferromagnet: the underlying dynamics is rotationally
 symmetric, but there is an interaction which tends to align the spins of
 neighbouring atoms in the ferromagnet, causing the ground state to be one
 with all spins aligned.
 This ground state violates the underlying rotational symmetry and a hypothetica
l microscopic physicist living inside the ferromagnet may take a long time
 to notice that there is no such thing as a preferred direction in space.
 This situation is schematically depicted in Figure

\emph on

 wrong physical predictions.
 It is important to note that the problem is with the method of calculation,
 not the underlying theory itself.
 If one takes the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA predictions at face value one may reject a physically correct model
 on the basis of an incorrect prediction.
 Therefore it is critical to gain a better understanding of the symmetry
 problem in order for

Electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) is a hypothetical process which may have
 taken place in the very early universe, when the temperature of the universe
 was of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

.
 EWBG creates an asymmetry in the abundance of baryons (protons, neutrons
 and related particles which also have the quantum numbers of three bound
 quarks) and anti-baryons.
 This asymmetry persists after the universe cools down and is ultimately
 responsible for the abundance of matter in the universe.
 EWBG is considered in this section as a case study of a real physics proposal
 intimately involving both non-perturbative and non-equilibrium aspects.
 As such, it is difficult to compute accurate and reliable EWBG predictions
 from fundamental physics.
 The purpose of the following discussion is to highlight these aspects of
 EWBG, not to give a comprehensive review of the current state of the field.
 For more detailed treatments the reader is encouraged to consult the original
 literature cited below.

It is well known that for every type of matter particle (electron, proton,
 neutron, quarks etc.) there is a corresponding antiparticle with the same
 mass and opposite charge.
 This is now understood to be a consequence of combining the principles
 of special relativity and quantum mechanics, which requires that antiparticles
 exist and have closely related properties to the corresponding particles
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is sometimes said that neutral particles such as the photon and Higgs
 boson have no anti-particles, or that they are their own anti-particles.
 This is a matter of semantics, not physics, and the two descriptions are
 equivalent.
 The convention of this thesis is that 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 particle species have a corresponding anti-particle species (which is sometimes
 identical to the particle species).
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is a very robust result, requiring only basic physical principles,
 and it is satisfied by the SM.
 Further, the standard cosmological model of the universe with a cosmological
 constant and cold dark matter (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

CDM) predicts that the early universe was in a very hot and dense state,
 where the maximum temperature that the universe reaches could be as high

 At extremely high temperatures the universe contains a plasma where particle
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

)/antiparticle (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

) pair creation and annihilation reactions such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gamma\leftrightarrow\psi\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

 are in equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the universe expands it cools, and when the temperature drops below 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim m_{\psi}c^{2}/k_{B}$
\end_inset

 the creation reactions 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gamma\to\psi\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

 become Boltzmann suppressed.
 However, the annihilation reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\bar{\psi}\to\gamma\gamma$
\end_inset

 remains efficient as long as the (thermally averaged) reaction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\sim\left\langle n\sigma v\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number density, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 of the universe 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\dot{a}/a$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the cosmic scale factor.
 In this regime particle/antiparticle pairs are annihilated, depleting the
 number densities of both and temporarily slowing the cooling of the plasma.
 Once 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\lesssim H$
\end_inset

 the annihilation reactions shut off and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

 effectively decouple from the plasma, a phenomenon known as

 After freeze out the

 simply track the expansion of the universe.
 (This story assumes that

\end_inset

 particles are stable for simplicity.) Thus one should expect the number
 density of any species to be determined by the mass, reaction rates and
 expansion history in the way described, allowing one to derive from a model
 of particle physics a prediction for the amount of matter and antimatter
 in the universe.

 should be comparable.

The simplest possible explanation for the observed

 is that it stems from an asymmetry of the initial condition of the universe.
 However a net baryon number 
\begin_inset Formula $B\neq0$
\end_inset

 initial condition for the universe is implausible as a solution to this
 problem for several reasons.
 First, if cosmic inflation is indeed the solution to the horizon, flatness
 and monopole problems in cosmology this requires at least about 60 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

-folds of expansion which would greatly dilute any initial baryon asymmetry.
 Second, if baryon number conservation is violated by any beyond standard
 model (

The SM has all three of the necessary ingredients: 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 violating sphaleron processes come from the non-perturbative electroweak

\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is maximally violated by the chiral fermion couplings of the weak interactions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 is violated by the complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
 mixing matrix in the quark sector, and the SM plasma could be driven out
 of equilibrium by the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sufficiently small Higgs mass the EWPT is a first order transition which
 proceeds by bubble formation, analogous to boiling water, a violent process
 that locally departs from thermal equilibrium at the bubble walls.
 It was within the realm of possibility then, before the late 1990s (when
 the LEP2 experiment began placing limits on the Higgs mass), that the SM
 alone could account for baryogenesis.
 However, it is now known that the Higgs mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{H}=126\ \mathrm{GeV}>72\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $72\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 is the critical point of the EWPT.
 For values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{H}$
\end_inset

 greater than the critical value the EWPT is a smooth crossover transition
 which does not depart from equilibrium.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{H}$
\end_inset

 is too large for the EWPT to depart from equilibrium, violating the second
 Sakharov condition.
 Further, detailed computations show that the 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 violating phase of the CKM matrix is many orders of magnitude too small
 to account for the observed BAU

 Of those only a handful are well motivated and provide decent prospects

 These are the models that propose new particles at or below the electroweak

 One prominent option is to include additional scalar fields that couple

 Such scalars can come from supersymmetric (

The mechanism of

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

 violation is topological in nature and as such is invisible to perturbation
 theory.
 At zero temperature it proceeds by quantum tunnelling between gauge vacua
 with different topologies.
 A potential barrier separates these field configurations and the leading
 contribution to the transition rate at zero temperature comes from the
 semi-classical tunnelling trajectory called an 
\emph on
instanton
\emph default
 (see, e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 argued that at finite temperature the transition proceeds by classical
 fluctuations 
\emph on
over the barrier
\emph default
 at a rate increasing exponentially with temperature, finally becoming unsuppres
sed entirely at sufficiently high temperature.
 The height of the barrier can be computed by finding the (unstable) configurati
on of the gauge and Higgs fields that maximises the energy atop the barrier.
 These configurations are called 
\emph on
sphalerons

 and were discovered by Klinkhamer and Manton

 In vacuum 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$

 Transitions from one gauge vacuum to another are possible and when this
 happens the chiral anomaly is responsible for changing 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=\Delta L=3\Delta\mathcal{K}$

 More generally 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=\Delta L=n_{g}\Delta\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the number of fermion generations.

 The sphaleron is the minimal energy configuration interpolating between
 two adjacent vacua (i.e., the smallest barrier).
 Note that this figure is only illustrative.
 To find an honest expression for the potential energy one needs to develop
 a one parameter ansatz for the gauge and Higgs fields which passes through
 the vacuum and sphaleron field configurations at appropriate parameter
 values and compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 and the energy of the field configuration as a function of the parameter.
 The resulting figure is somewhat arbitrary, depending on the choice of
 ansatz.
 Physically, there are many paths over the ridge in field space represented
 by the sphaleron.

The height of the barrier and the sphaleron solution are found from a static
 configuration of the gauge and Higgs fields that extremises the energy
 subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the required Chern-Simons
 number.
 The resulting field profiles must be found numerically

, but in the 
\begin_inset Formula $g'\to0$
\end_inset

 limit they depend only on the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{2}/g^{2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the Higgs self-coupling.
 The energy can then be written
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E=\frac{4\pi v}{g}C\left(\frac{\lambda^{2}}{g^{2}}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the numerical factor 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(\lambda^{2}/g^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 has been estimated in the original literature.
 Its precise value is not important here, but 
\begin_inset Formula $C\sim\mathcal{O}\left(1-3\right)$
\end_inset

 for the whole range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{2}/g^{2}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $+\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the height of the barrier at zero temperature is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\ \mathrm{TeV}$
\end_inset

.
 One can thus think of the sphaleron, very roughly, as an unstable bound
 configuration with of the order of 30 each of 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{+},W^{-},Z$
\end_inset

 and 10 Higgs particles in a region 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-17}\ \mathrm{m}$
\end_inset

 across.
 In reality the sphaleron is a coherent state, not a particle number eigenstate,
 so this picture is at best qualitative.
 However, this illustrates that, while 
\begin_inset Formula $10\ \mathrm{TeV}$
\end_inset

 might not sound like a terribly high energy for modern colliders, sphalerons
 are difficult if not impossible to produce at present day collider experiments

The second Sakharov criterion requires that the early universe depart from
 thermal equilibrium at some point.
 This is achieved in EWBG by a first order phase transition associated with
 electroweak symmetry breaking.
 Recall that if the Higgs field(s) has a non-vanishing expectation value
 the electroweak symmetry is said to be broken, while if the expectation
 value is zero the symmetry is manifest or unbroken.
 The behaviour of the Higgs field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 in equilibrium can be determined by minimising the effective potential
 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 is determined from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\left[\phi\right]$
\end_inset

, which is the (Euclidean) 
\emph on
one particle irreducible
\emph default
 
\emph on

\emph default

 This formalism will be discussed in detail in Chapter

The history of the universe in this scenario is as follows.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T>T_{+}$
\end_inset

 the electroweak symmetry is unbroken.
 As the universe expands the temperature drops to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\star}<T<T_{+}$
\end_inset

.
 In this regime bubbles of broken phase can form by thermal fluctuations
 but these are unstable and rapidly disappear.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T=T_{\star}$
\end_inset

 the interior of the bubbles of broken phase are degenerate with the unbroken
 phase, but there is an energy cost associated with the bubble walls that
 still renders them unstable.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{-}<T<T_{\star}$
\end_inset

 the broken phase has an energy advantage 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V=-V_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\phi_{\mathrm{min}},T\right)$
\end_inset

 and a spherical bubble of broken phase has an energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E=4\pi R^{2}\sigma-\frac{4\pi}{3}R^{3}\Delta V,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the surface tension of the bubble wall.
 The bubble will expand if it is larger than the critical size 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\star}=2\sigma/\Delta V$
\end_inset

 The rate of bubble formation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\sim\exp\left(-E_{\star}/T\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\star}=\frac{16\pi}{3}\frac{\sigma^{3}}{\Delta V^{2}}$
\end_inset

 is the energy of the critical bubble.
 Bubble nucleation becomes cosmologically significant when this rate exceeds
 the Hubble rate, which requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 drop sufficiently below 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\star}$
\end_inset

.
 At this time bubbles begin to form and expand, eventually filling the universe.
 The volume fraction of broken phase as a function of time and the completion
 time of the phase transition can be computed from a simple macroscopic
 model once a few plasma parameters are known, namely the latent heat, surface
 tension and wall velocity

\begin_layout Standard
The friction on bubble walls is the result of particles in the unbroken
 phase scattering on the bubble wall and being driven out of local thermal
 equilibrium.
 It is this breaking of local thermal equilibrium which satisfies the Sakharov
 criterion for baryogenesis in EWBG models.
 If the scatterings also violate 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

, e.g.
 by preferentially scattering left handed particles, then a net asymmetry
 of left handed particles builds up in the unbroken phase in front of the
 wall (balanced by an opposite right handed asymmetry which passes through
 the wall).
 The left handed particles outside the wall bias sphaleron transitions to
 produce a net baryon number.
 It is important that in the broken phase the sphaleron transitions are
 turned off, otherwise they will wash out the net asymmetry.
 This requires that the phase transition be sufficiently strong, typically
 taken to mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi/T_{\star}\gtrsim1$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi$
\end_inset

 is the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 between the phases at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\star}$
\end_inset

, but it is not trivial to determine how strong is really strong enough.
 Indeed, a proper determination of the washout factor, beyond a few conservative
 estimates, is one of the main outstanding problems in EWBG

The qualitative reason 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 violation leads to baryogenesis is as follows.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 is violated in quark-wall scattering such that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}+\bar{q}_{R}$
\end_inset

 reflect more readily than 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{R}+\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, temporarily 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sphalerons for illustrative purposes.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{R}+\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

 build up in front of the bubble wall (recall that Higgs-Yukawa interactions
 change fermion chirality) while a compensating 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 asymmetry passes through into the broken phase.
 There is no baryon asymmetry at this stage, and if it were not for sphaleron
 transitions no asymmetry would be generated: though the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{R}+\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

 tend to reflect from the bubble wall they will all eventually pass through,
 certainly by the time the broken phase fills all of space.
 Now turn sphalerons back on.
 Sphalerons only act on the 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 particles, converting 
\begin_inset Formula $3n_{f}\bar{q}_{L}\to n_{f}l_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3n_{f}q_{L}\to n_{f}\bar{l}_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 The rate of the former process, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=+1$
\end_inset

, exceeds the rate of the latter, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=-1$
\end_inset

, since there are more 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}$
\end_inset

 in front of the wall.
 Hence a net baryon number is generated in front of the bubble wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly the net baryon asymmetry produced by this mechanism depends on a
 number of factors: how strong is the 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 violation in the reflection/transmission coefficients; how far do reflected
 particles diffuse into the plasma ahead of the bubble wall and for how
 long; what is the rate of sphaleron transitions in the plasma ahead of
 and behind the bubble wall; and how fast are other processes besides sphalerons
 which tend to wash out CP asymmetries (without producing B or L asymmetries)?
 The current practice for quantitative calculations is to: (1) calculate
 bubble wall reflection/transmission coefficients using a non-equilibrium
 quantum transport theory or semi-classical Boltzmann equation, using bubble
 wall velocities obtained from a hydrodynamic treatment and ignoring the
 back-reaction of the generated asymmetries on the bubble wall; (2) perform
 lattice Monte Carlo calculations of the sphaleron rate, in one of a few
 simplified models, in equilibrium at various temperatures to calibrate
 a semi-empirical formula which hopefully applies out of equilibrium to
 the required accuracy; and (3) combine these elements in a network of continuit
y equations which are integrated numerically to find the final baryon (and
 lepton) asymmetry

 As the temperature decreases the universe smoothly evolves from an unbroken

The obvious major problem facing EWBG scenarios is the order of the electroweak
 phase transition.
 It is necessary for the transition to proceed through bubble formation
 as in a first order transition, and also that the scalar field behind the
 bubble wall be sufficiently large (a measure of the strength of the phase
 transition) that sphaleron processes are effectively shut off, lest they
 erase the baryon asymmetry that was so painstakingly created.
 The most straightforward approach to strengthening the EWPT is adding new
 scalar fields which are strongly coupled to the Higgs.
 However, any models with new particles necessarily have undetermined parameters
 which must be scanned to assess the range of EWBG predictions possible.
 Typically perturbation theory is used since it is relatively easy to scan
 parameters, however perturbative results do not necessarily agree with
 more accurate (but harder to scan) lattice methods.
 See e.g.

 estimates.
 Unfortunately these lattice methods have been applied only to a few well
 studied models such as the MSSM.

 The new physics manifests as additional operators in the Lagrangian:

 Of all of these operators, only one affects the Higgs potential: the dimension

 Thus a conservative, and largely model independent, exploration of BSM

 The

Thus it is easy to strengthen the EWPT in BSM models of current phenomenological
 interest.
 However, questions can be raised about the computation of the phase transition
 thermodynamics.
 A conceptual question of great practical import is the gauge dependence
 of this theory, which is relevant in the Higgs theory because an expectation
 value of a gauge-variant quantity like 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is physically meaningless.
 Two methods are available to check the gauge dependence of the result:
 redo the computation in a general class of gauges such as the 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\xi}$
\end_inset

 gauge and check the dependence on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 parameter, or develop a formulation using only manifestly gauge invariant
 quantities.
 An example of the first method is the jump of the order parameter at the
 critical temperature,

 Unfortunately it is infeasible to implement and interpret lattice computations

 In cases of phenomenological interest for EWBG where multiple scalar fields
 are participating in the phase transition the nucleation rate is in principle
 a straightforward extension of these standard results, but the computational

 The faster an asymmetric species diffuses, the longer it remains ahead

 Thus a solid understanding of the scattering and transport of plasma particles

In summary, electroweak baryogenesis is a plausible mechanism for explaining
 one of the greatest mysteries: the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.
 The size of the asymmetry is well established within seconds of the big
 bang, and is crucial for the production of light elements in the early
 universe.
 If it were not for some mechanism of baryogenesis there would be very little
 matter in the universe, and essentially no galaxies, stars, heavy elements
 or life.
 Yet, remarkably, EWBG provides a testable mechanism for controlling the
 late time abundance of matter in the universe and is already being constrained
 by the LHC.
 EWBG in specific models such as the MSSM is already under a great deal
 of strain, although ruling it out in a completely model independent test
 may have to wait for the next collider.
 At the present time experiments are catching up to theoretical speculations
 at the electroweak scale, and formulating solid theoretical predictions
 should be a top priority.
 In particular, it should be possible to say with confidence whether a first
 order phase transition exists in any particular extended Higgs sector,
 and what the critical temperature, nucleation rate, strength of the phase
 transition, CP violation generation rate and sphaleron rates are in all
 relevant regimes.
 These quantities have been well established in a handful of benchmark models
 but for the most part questionable estimates and conservative rules of
 thumb are used to establish the viability of EWBG within a particular model.

 non-Gaussian) initial conditions, with a well established and tractable
 renormalisation procedure, while avoiding infrared singularities, unphysical
 transients and secularities though consistent and systematically improvable
 re-summations.
 It would be desirable to see the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-abelian
 gauge theory or biased sphaleron transitions in real time, and a controlled
 analytical framework capable of this would provide a valuable check of

 Thus quantum field theory (QFT) is often considered a special case of quantum

 goes to infinity.
 However, the limit usually cannot be taken in a rigorous way and in fact
 one proceeds the other way, deriving QM as a special case of QFT in zero
 spatial dimensions (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}$

 Furthermore, there are non-trivial QFTs with no particle content whatsoever
 (so called

 Still, there is a close relation between QM and QFT: for each formalism

 However, in QFT it is often far more convenient to use the functional integral

Commutators at unequal times must be found by evolving the field with its
 equations of motion.
 For a free field this can be done exactly.
 The free field Hamiltonian is quadratic in fields and momenta, exactly
 analogous to the QM harmonic oscillator:

\begin_inset Formula $m$

 quantity with dimensions of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m\hbar/c$
\end_inset

, which is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 The Hamiltonian equations of motion are then

which can be rearranged to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{\left(3\right)}\left(\boldsymbol{0}\right)=\left(2\pi\right)^{-3}\int_{\boldsymbol{x}}\mathrm{e}^{i\boldsymbol{x}\cdot\boldsymbol{0}}=\left(2\pi\right)^{-3}\mathrm{V}$

\end_inset

where the time component of 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\mu}$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\boldsymbol{k}}$
\end_inset

 in the exponentials.
 Note that when 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 In this case one can see that the commutator vanishes by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{k}\to-\boldsymbol{k}$

 To show that this holds in all frames one needs to show that the integration
 measure is in fact Lorentz invariant, as the exponentials are manifestly

 Consider the identity
\begin_inset Formula

\frac{1}{2\omega_{\boldsymbol{k}}}=\int\mathrm{d}k_{0}\delta\left(k_{0}^{2}-\omega_{\boldsymbol{k}}^{2}\right)\Theta\left(k_{0}\right)=\int\mathrm{d}k_{0}\delta\left(k^{2}-m^{2}\right)\Theta\left(k_{0}\right).

Then

which is manifestly invariant under the isochronous (i.e.

 Thus fields commute at spacelike separation.

 The idea is to do the time evolution a little bit at a time.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{f}$
\end_inset

 is later than 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 it is possible to break the finite time evolution into a succession of
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 steps 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}\to\Sigma_{1}\to\Sigma_{2}\to\cdots\to\Sigma_{N-1}\to\Sigma_{f}$
\end_inset

 and take the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 limit such that each step represents an infinitesimal time evolution.
 Formally this is done by repeatedly inserting resolutions of the identity
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbb{I}}=\int\mathcal{D}\left[\phi\left(x\in\Sigma\right)\right]\Ket{\phi;\Sigma}\Bra{\phi;\Sigma},

\end_inset

To simplify this further one can assume that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

s are all flat and parallel (the general case can be recovered from the
 final result).
 This means that there is an inertial coordinate system where the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

 is constant on each 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 One can further assume, without loss of generality, that the hypersurfaces
 are equally spaced.
 That is, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}=t_{i}+\epsilon k$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\left(t_{f}-t_{i}\right)/N$

In order to make practical use of the functional integral it is necessary
 to have some way of characterising the initial and final states, handling
 the overall normalisation and evaluating the integral itself.
 Each of these typically require regularisation to handle divergences and
 renormalisation to express the input parameters in terms of physical observable
s.
 The way all of these are implemented depends on the physical application
 being considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the setting of most particle physics is vacuum field theory.
 One is usually interested in the scattering of a small number of particles
 which only interact in a small spacetime region.
 Long before and after the interaction the particles are effectively free,
 so the initial and final states can be approximated by free particle states
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim a_{\boldsymbol{k}_{1}}^{\dagger}a_{\boldsymbol{k}_{2}}^{\dagger}\cdots a_{\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}^{\dagger}\Ket{\text{vac}}$
\end_inset

 and the appropriate observable is the S-matrix element.
 The 
\emph on
Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann
\emph default
 (LSZ) reduction formulae connect the S-matrix elements for the asymptotic
 free particle states to the vacuum-to-vacuum transition matrix elements
 of a time ordered product of interacting fields (a 
\emph on
correlation
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Green function
\emph default
).
 The essential idea of the LSZ formulae is that, while the free field operators
 create and destroy single particles, interacting fields have some amplitude
 to create and destroy multi-particle states.
 Nevertheless, multi-particle wave packets spread differently than single
 particle wave packets, so that the single particle contributions can be
 isolated and related to the asymptotic free particle states.
 The Green functions can be evaluated by using, essentially, the formulae
 of the previous section.
 However it is necessary to characterise the initial and final physical
 vacuum state and handle the overall normalisation.
 The 
\emph on
Gell-Mann
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Low
\emph default
 theorem accomplishes both.
 The idea is that, instead of trying to find the wavefunctional of the vacuum
 state, one can use

 evolution 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim\exp\left(-\epsilon t\hat{H}\right)$

This assumes that the vacuum state is non-degenerate and separated by a
 finite spectral gap from any excited states.
 In particular, this implies that this formalism for vacuum field theory
 is strictly speaking invalid for massless particles.
 Yet, massless particles can be handled in this formalism provided one takes
 care of infrared (i.e.
 low energy) divergences and computes inclusive cross sections, i.e.
 including processes with the emission of extra soft particles in the final
 state which are invisible in realistic detectors.
 A detailed treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this thesis,

 The normalisation factor is taken care of by noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Braket{\text{vac}|\text{vac}}=1$

 an undisturbed vacuum remains vacuum.
 Thus one can simply divide by this factor, giving
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functional integrand does not depend on the phases of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{n\boldsymbol{p}}$
\end_inset

, so these contribute to the normalisation.
 The integrals over the magnitudes are Gaussian, giving
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=N'\prod_{n\boldsymbol{p}}\left[\beta^{2}\left(\omega_{n}^{2}+\boldsymbol{p}^{2}+m^{2}\right)\right]^{-1/2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where all the normalisation factors are absorbed in 
\begin_inset Formula $N'$
\end_inset

 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\ln Z & = & \ln N'-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\boldsymbol{p}}\ln\left[\beta^{2}\left(\omega_{n}^{2}+\boldsymbol{p}^{2}+m^{2}\right)\right]\nonumber \\

 & = & \ln N'-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\boldsymbol{p}}\left\{ \sum_{n}\ln\left[\left(2\pi n\right)^{2}+1\right]+\int_{1}^{\beta\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}}\mathrm{d}\theta\left(1+\frac{2}{\mathrm{e}^{\theta}-1}\right)\right\} \nonumber \\

The identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}1/\left(n^{2}+\left(\theta/2\pi\right)^{2}\right)=\left(2\pi^{2}/\theta\right)\left(1+2/\left(\mathrm{e}^{\theta}-1\right)\right)$

 The rest of the steps are straightforward evaluations.

 fixes the normalisation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

and finally (on taking the infinite volume limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\boldsymbol{p}}\to\mathrm{V}\int_{\boldsymbol{p}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln Z=-\mathrm{V}\int_{\boldsymbol{p}}\left[\frac{1}{2}\beta\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}+\ln\left(1-\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}}\right)\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The energy density is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{E}{\mathrm{V}}=-\frac{\partial_{\beta}\ln Z}{\mathrm{V}}=\int_{\boldsymbol{p}}\left(\frac{1}{2}\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}+\frac{\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}}{\mathrm{e}^{\beta\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}}-1}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is the familiar Bose-Einstein contribution plus a vacuum energy contributi
on which can be subtracted.
 Similarly, the pressure is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P=T\partial_{\mathrm{V}}\ln Z=-\int_{\boldsymbol{p}}\left[\frac{1}{2}\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}+T\ln\left(1-\mathrm{e}^{-\beta\omega_{\boldsymbol{p}}}\right)\right].
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that there is a vacuum contribution to the pressure as well.
 The fact that this contribution is equal to the negative of the vacuum
 energy is in fact a consequence of Lorentz invariance
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The energy-momentum tensor of a Lorentz invariant state must be proportional
 to the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}\propto\eta_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 since there are no other spacetime tensors available to construct it from.
 Thus the pressure (i.e.
 the diagonal space-space components) is equal and opposite to the energy
 density (the time-time component).
\end_layout

 and this provides a nice check of the formalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formalisms sketched above for vacuum and finite temperature field theory
 can be naturally generalised to the contour or non-equilibrium Green function
 method which also allows the treatment of non-equilibrium field theory.
 The contour method has been used extensively in various fields of condensed
 matter and particle physics, from molecular transport and ultra-cold atomic
 gases to nano-electronics, nuclear physics and cosmology.
 The research literature using these techniques is vast, and there are good
 recent books introducing them in condensed matter

 The contour method (as defined by

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of the method is quite simple.
 Consider a quantum system in some initial state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\Psi_{0}}$
\end_inset

 at an initial time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the expectation value 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 of some operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
O\left(t\right)=\Braket{\Psi\left(t\right)|\hat{O}\left(t\right)|\Psi\left(t\right)}=\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\hat{U}\left(t_{0},t\right)\hat{O}\left(t\right)\hat{U}\left(t,t_{0}\right)|\Psi_{0}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{U}\left(t,t_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the time evolution operator.
 As usual 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{U}\left(t_{2},t_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}>t_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed in terms of a time ordered exponential
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{U}\left(t_{2},t_{1}\right)=\mathrm{T}\left\{ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathrm{d}\tau\ \hat{H}\left(\tau\right)\right)\right\} ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

but, for 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}<t_{1}$
\end_inset

, an 
\emph on
anti-time ordered
\emph default
 exponential is required:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{U}\left(t_{2},t_{1}\right)=\tilde{\mathrm{T}}\left\{ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathrm{d}\tau\ \hat{H}\left(\tau\right)\right)\right\} ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathrm{T}}$
\end_inset

 orders operators in the opposite sense to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{T}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 earlier times to the left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Substituting these in the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
O\left(t\right)=\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\tilde{\mathrm{T}}\left\{ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t}^{t_{0}}\mathrm{d}\tau\ \hat{H}\left(\tau\right)\right)\right\} \hat{O}\left(t\right)\mathrm{T}\left\{ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\mathrm{d}\tau\ \hat{H}\left(\tau\right)\right)\right\} |\Psi_{0}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be simplified by interpreting the time evolution as along a 
\emph on
two branched
\emph default
 contour 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 which runs from 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 then doubles back to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An explicit mapping of 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\left(t_{0},2t-t_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 to ordinary time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\in\left(t_{0},t\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=z$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}\leq z\leq t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=2t-z$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<z<2t-t_{0}$
\end_inset

, but this is rarely needed in practice.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a 
\emph on
contour time ordering
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{T}_{C}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
O\left(t\right)=\Braket{\Psi_{0}|\mathrm{T}_{C}\left\{ \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z\ \hat{H}\left(z\right)\right)\hat{O}\left(t\right)\right\} |\Psi_{0}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Further, both branches of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 can be extended to an arbitrary time 
\begin_inset Formula $T>t$
\end_inset

, removing the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 dependence of the contour.
 Since there are no operators in the time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t,T\right)$
\end_inset

 the segment of the evolution from 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and back is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{U}\left(t,T\right)\hat{U}\left(T,t\right)=\hat{\mathbb{I}}$
\end_inset

 and cancels outs, so no modification of the above expression is necessary.
 There is an ambiguity where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 should go on the contour, i.e.
 how to generalise 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}\left(t\right)\to\hat{O}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

, but for convenience 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be the same operator on both branches.
\end_layout

The generalisation of this result to multiple operators and a general initial
 density matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}_{0}=\sum_{n}p_{n}\ket n\bra n$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the probability that the system is in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket n$
\end_inset

, is obvious:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle O_{1}\left(z_{1}\right)O_{2}\left(z_{2}\right)\cdots\right\rangle =\mathrm{Tr}\left\{ \hat{\rho}_{0}\mathrm{T}_{C}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z\ \hat{H}\left(z\right)\right)\hat{O}_{1}\left(z_{1}\right)\hat{O}_{2}\left(z_{2}\right)\cdots\right]\right\} .
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Proceeding still further, a general density matrix can be written 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{0}=Z^{-1}\exp\left(-\beta\hat{H}_{M}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 Hermitian operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is chosen to ensure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}\hat{\rho}_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 (in fact 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 can be absorbed into a shift of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$
\end_inset

 if so desired).
 If the Hamiltonian of the system is time independent and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}=\hat{H}$
\end_inset

 then this describes a thermal equilibrium state at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta$
\end_inset

.
 However, there is no loss of generality in writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}_{0}$
\end_inset

 in this way with a general 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$
\end_inset

, and out of equilibrium the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is entirely arbitrary, equivalent to an arbitrary normalisation convention
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Now note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-\beta\hat{H}_{M}\right)=\exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{0}-i\beta\hbar}\mathrm{d}\tau\ \hat{H}_{M}\right)=\hat{U}\left(t_{0}-i\beta\hbar,t_{0};\hat{H}_{M}\right)$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 up to an overall normalisation factor the initial density matrix can be
 written as the time evolution operator for an 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle \mathrm{T}_{C}\left[O_{1}\left(z_{1}\right)O_{2}\left(z_{2}\right)\cdots\right]\right\rangle  & = & \frac{\mathrm{Tr}\left\{ \mathrm{T}_{C}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z\ \hat{H}\left(z\right)\right)\hat{O}_{1}\left(z_{1}\right)\hat{O}_{2}\left(z_{2}\right)\cdots\right]\right\} }{\mathrm{Tr}\left\{ \mathrm{T}_{C}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z\ \hat{H}\left(z\right)\right)\right]\right\} }\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{\int\mathcal{D}\left[\phi\right]\exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{C}\mathcal{L}\right)\hat{O}_{1}\left(z_{1}\right)\hat{O}_{2}\left(z_{2}\right)\cdots}{\int\mathcal{D}\left[\phi\right]\exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{C}\mathcal{L}\right)},
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where the second line specialises to field theory and extends the path integral
 and Lagrangian to all branches of the contour.
 The imaginary branch of the contour is called the 
\emph on
Matsubara
\emph default
 branch, as this is the same contour used in the imaginary time field theory
 formalism for thermal equilibrium problems.
 The similarity of this result to the usual vacuum field theory formula
 should be obvious, however 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 assumptions have been made about the initial/final state or spectrum of
 the theory.
 This greatly extends the applicability of the formalism compared to the
 usual vacuum field theory.
 Despite this, much of the technical machinery of the vacuum theory, including
 path integrals, Feynman diagrams, effective actions and renormalisation,
 can be carried over with suitable modifications for contour time ordering
 as opposed to regular time ordering.
 Difficulties come from the extra degrees of freedom (fields on the backward
 branch of the contour), the explicit appearance of memory effects, and
 choosing a 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$
\end_inset

 that allows for consistent and practically solvable renormalisation conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objects of interest are the correlation functions of field operators,
 i.e.
 objects like
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

in a scalar field theory.
 Now all the time coordinates run on the time contour 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 There are nine possibilities for the time arguments of the Green function:
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be on either of the forward, backward or Matsubara branches of the
 contour independently.
 This leads to the definition of 
\emph on

 Green functions, with real time arguments, for each case.
 There is also the possibility for a singular part, proportional to a contour

\begin_layout Standard
The origin of some of the names can be seen by visualising the function
 arguments on the time contour.
 For example, the lesser function is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)=-i\left\langle \hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\hat{\phi}\left(x\right)\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

i.e.
 the second argument appears to the left of the first in the matrix element,
 regardless of the relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 So the lesser function orders the fields 
\emph on
as if 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}<y^{0}$
\end_inset

, even if it is not.
 The hook functions are similarly visual.
 Consider the left hook function 
\begin_inset Formula $\lhook\Delta\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

: the left argument is on the Matsubara (vertical) branch and the right
 argument is on a real time (horizontal) branch (it does not matter which
 one since the contour ordering is the same in both cases).
 The contour delta function is defined so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z'\ \delta_{C}\left(z,z'\right)f\left(z'\right)=f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 as usual.
 The only non-trivial reduction to an ordinary delta function is when (taking
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 for simplicity) 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-i\tau$
\end_inset

 lies on the Matsubara branch:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z'\ \delta_{C}\left(-i\tau,z'\right)f\left(z'\right)=f\left(-i\tau\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The only contribution can come from 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 on the Matsubara branch, so substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $z'=-i\tau'$
\end_inset

 giving
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{-i\beta\hbar}\mathrm{d}\left(-i\tau'\right)\delta_{C}\left(-i\tau,-i\tau'\right)f\left(-i\tau'\right)=f\left(-i\tau\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{C}\left(-i\tau,-i\tau'\right)=i\delta\left(\tau-\tau'\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When working with the Keldysh components it is convenient to have identities
 for the reduction of frequently occurring convolutions and products of
 contour time functions to their components.
 These identities are called 
\emph on
Langreth rules
\emph default
 and are summarised in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Langreth-rules"

\end_inset

.
 These identities are proved in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stefanucci2013"

\end_inset

 chapter 5.
 The most common use of these identities is in the reduction of equations
 of motion for contour ordered Green functions to equations for real times
 functions.
 For example, if a scalar field Green function obeys a Dyson equation of
 the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\square_{x}\Delta\left(x,y\right)=i\delta_{C}\left(x,y\right)+\int_{z}\Sigma\left(x,z\right)\Delta\left(z,y\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\square_{x}=\partial_{\mu}^{\left(x\right)}\partial^{\left(x\right)\mu}$
\end_inset

 and the self energy function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is also defined on the time contour, the Langreth rules show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{<}$
\end_inset

 obeys (suppressing arguments)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\square_{x}\Delta^{<}=\Sigma^{<}\cdot\Delta^{A}+\Sigma^{R}\cdot\Delta^{<}+\rhook\Sigma\star\lhook\Delta,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

an equation suitable for numerical solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Green functions contain the physical information of the theory.
 This can be seen explicitly in the simplifying case of free fields where
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=0$
\end_inset

 and the Dyson equation can be solved simply by Fourier transform.
 Writing
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{\left(a\right)}\left(x,y\right)=\int_{p}\mathrm{e}^{-ip\left(x-y\right)}\Delta^{\left(a\right)}\left(p\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 denotes the Keldysh component, one has 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Calzetta1988"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta^{\mathrm{T}}\left(p\right) & = & \frac{1}{p^{2}-m^{2}+i\epsilon}-2\pi if\left(p\right)\delta\left(p^{2}-m^{2}\right),\\
\Delta^{<}\left(p\right)=\Delta^{>}\left(-p\right) & = & -2\pi i\left[\Theta\left(p^{0}\right)+f\left(p\right)\right]\delta\left(p^{2}-m^{2}\right),\\
\Delta^{\tilde{\mathrm{T}}}\left(p\right) & = & -\frac{1}{p^{2}-m^{2}-i\epsilon}-2\pi if\left(p\right)\delta\left(p^{2}-m^{2}\right),
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{<}\left(p\right)=\Delta^{>}\left(-p\right)$
\end_inset

 follows by Hermiticity of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}$
\end_inset

, and the fact that the same function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 is found on all of the right hand sides is due to the fact that the commutator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\hat{\phi}\left(x\right),\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 is a c-number, so its expectation value 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\left\langle \left[\hat{\phi}\left(x\right),\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right]\right\rangle =\Delta^{>}\left(x,y\right)-\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 is independent of the state.
 By considering the anticommutator 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\left\{ \hat{\phi}\left(x\right),\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right\} =\Delta^{>}\left(x,y\right)+\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 must be real and even.
 Another constraint is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{xy}h^{\star}\left(x\right)i\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)h\left(y\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

 for all real functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, which implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, an equilibrium computation shows that there 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 is just the Bose-Einstein occupation number of the mode 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 naturally has the interpretation of a statistical distribution function
 which can be extended to arbitrary states.
 Thus knowledge of the Green function is equivalent to knowledge of the
 statistical distribution function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other observables of the theory are simply related to the Green functions
 since they are polynomials in the fields and their derivatives.
 For example, in a theory with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 scalar fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,\cdots,N$
\end_inset

, with an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{O}\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 symmetry, the conserved 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{O}\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 currents are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
j_{\mu}^{A}=i\left\langle \phi_{a}T_{ab}^{A}\overleftrightarrow{\partial_{\mu}}\phi_{b}\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ab}^{A}=-T_{ba}^{A}$
\end_inset

 is a generator of rotations which has been written in a basis of the 
\begin_inset Formula $A=1,\cdots,N\left(N-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 independent generators and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\overleftrightarrow{\partial_{\mu}}g\equiv f\left(\partial_{\mu}g\right)-\left(\partial_{\mu}f\right)g$
\end_inset

.
 This can be written in terms of the Green function as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
j_{\mu}^{A}\left(x\right)=iT_{ab}^{A}\left.\left(\partial_{\mu}^{\left(y\right)}-\partial_{\mu}^{\left(x\right)}\right)\left\langle \phi_{a}\left(x\right)\phi_{b}\left(y\right)\right\rangle \right|_{y\to x}=T_{ab}^{A}\left.\left(\partial_{\mu}^{\left(x\right)}-\partial_{\mu}^{\left(y\right)}\right)\Delta_{ab}^{>}\left(x,y\right)\right|_{y\to x}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly, if the theory has a quartic coupling the energy-momentum tensor
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu}=\left\langle \partial_{\mu}\phi_{a}\partial_{\nu}\phi_{a}-\eta_{\mu\nu}\left(\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\rho}\phi_{a}\partial^{\rho}\phi_{a}-\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\phi_{a}\phi_{a}-\frac{\lambda}{4!}\left(\phi_{a}\phi_{a}\right)^{2}\right)\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which can be written in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\left(4\right)}=\left\langle \mathrm{T}_{C}\left[\phi_{a}\phi_{b}\phi_{c}\phi_{d}\right]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter has tried to motivate the investigation which forms the remainder
 of this thesis.
 This started with a general discussion of the gaps which exist between
 theory and experiment in situations involving strongly interacting particles
 and many particles out of equilibrium.
 Electroweak baryogenesis was then given as a concrete example and discussed
 in some detail, with an emphasis on those areas which have been hindered
 by an inability to compute.
 Then, laying the groundwork for the remainder of the thesis, basic quantum
 field theory was reviewed focusing on the functional integral formalism.
 It has been shown that a common formula for the generating functional can
 be used for scattering, thermal equilibrium and generic non-equilibrium
 problems by specifying a choice of time contour.
 The fundamental objects of field theory are the Green functions which can
 be straightforwardly connected to physical observables such as densities,
 currents and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap2"

\end_inset

 introduces the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-particle irreducible effective action (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA) techniques with an emphasis on their application to non-perturbative
 quantum field theory.
 This includes a review of the standard theory surrounding the methods and
 concludes with a novel investigation into the analytic properties of the
 solution of the 2PIEA in a toy model which can be compared to the exact
 solution and contrasted with other non-perturbative techniques.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap3"

\end_inset

 begins the consideration of symmetries in the thesis by introducing the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{O}\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 scalar field theory which forms the basis of the remainder of the work.
 The Ward identities for the theory (which encode the symmetries of the
 theory in effective action language) are derived and it is shown that the
 expected identities no longer hold for truncations of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA.
 This result is known in the literature but is derived here in a way which
 is, to the author's knowledge, new.
 The 2PIEA is then solved in the Hartree-Fock approximation demonstrating
 this result explicitly.
 A contrast is then drawn between these results and those of the external
 propagator method and large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 method.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap4"

\end_inset

 introduces the symmetry improved 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA (SI-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA) as a means of overcoming the difficulty posed by violations of symmetries
 in truncated 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA.
 The novel work in this chapter is an extension of the symmetry improvement
 known in the literature from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{O}\left(2\right),\mathrm{O}\left(4\right)\to\mathrm{O}\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 and from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(\hbar^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 SI-2PIEA to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(\hbar^{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 SI-3PIEA.
 Additionally, several ambiguities in the original symmetry improvement
 procedure are identified and addressed.
 The renormalisation theory of these actions is discussed and solutions
 are presented in the Hartree-Fock approximation, as well as a few checks
 of the basic field theoretical consistency of the new actions.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap5"

\end_inset

 introduces a novel technique called soft symmetry improvement (SSI) aimed
 at overcoming the difficulties of the SI-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA.
 The SSI-2PIEA is derived, renormalised and solved in the Hartree-Fock approxima
tion.
 It is shown that the method is sensitive to the way the infinite volume
 / low temperature limit is taken and there are three limiting cases: a
 trivial reduction to the unimproved 2PIEA, a reduction to the SI-2PIEA,
 and a novel limit which possess some unusual features which are discussed.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap6"

\end_inset

 studies for the first time the non-equilibrium aspects of the SI-2PIEA
 by formulating the linear response theory for a system governed by the
 SI-2PIEA being driven away from equilibrium by a weak external perturbation.
 It is shown that the SI-2PIEA, and by a simple extension all SI-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA, are inconsistent with the linear response approximation.
 Finally, chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Discussion"

\end_inset

 is the discussion chapter drawing everything together and pinpointing direction
s for future work.
 Some derivations and results concerning the renormalisation theory which
 are inessential to the main flow of the text are collected in the appendices
