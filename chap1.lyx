There has been remarkable progress in physics in the last century.
 The revolutions of relativity and quantum mechanics in the first quarter
 of the 20th century led inevitably to the establishment of what is now
 known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the standard model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (SM) â€“ the mathematical formulation of the laws of nature at the most fundament
al level currently known.
 This model successfully explains phenomena on scales ranging from a few
 thousands of a proton radius

For the cognoscenti: I am including classical general relativity with a
 cosmological constant in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

standard model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for rhetorical purposes.
 This does not exactly match standard particle physics usage of the term
 though, despite the famous difficulties of quantum gravity, it is consistent
 to include general relativity as a low energy effective field theory (see,
 e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

).
 The cosmological model is taken as

 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 components of the universe are a cosmological constant and cold dark matter.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The outstanding puzzles where the standard model is known to fall short
 can be grouped into roughly three areas: questions about the character
 of the model itself which, although consistent, is arguably peculiar (e.g.
 the various fine tuning and hierarchy problems); questions about the behaviour
 of matter at extremely high energies which are mainly relevant to the early
 universe (e.q.
 questions about quantum gravity and the origin of matter); and questions
 about the behaviour of particles that may be abundant today, but are very
 weakly interacting with ordinary matter (neutrinos and dark matter).
 All of these questions are far removed from ordinary experience.
 The general consensus is that in the (limited) sense of knowing the underlying
 laws, all ordinary phenomena from atoms to solar systems are completely
 understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This statement should be incredible to anyone without a physics education,
 but it can be quickly supported by reading the published literature on
 fundamental physics (as conveniently summarised in, e.g., the annual Review
 of Particle Physics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) or by trawling the daily postings on the physics arXiv

: the research topics of interest to modern theoretical physicists lie very
 far from everyday experience.
 Physics students are taught to identify the relevant scales of length,
 time and energy in a problem and use the set of laws appropriate for that
 scale.
 However, they are also taught that this procedure is purely one of convenience,
 and that the laws governing phenomena at one scale can always be connected
 to the laws at neighbouring scales so that, for example, the laws of chemistry
 can be derived from the laws governing atoms which can in turn be derived
 from the laws governing sub-atomic particles and so on.
 In the language of particle physics and statistical mechanics this intuitive
 idea has been refined into the technically precise notion of effective
 field theories: a mathematical framework that allows one to mechanically
 derive the laws governing phenomena at larger distance scales from those
 governing smaller distance scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some embarrassing omissions in this tidy picture, however, all
 of which have to do with the 
\emph on
inability to calculate in practice what is calculable in principle
\emph default
.
 For instance, it is extremely difficult to compute, from the basic quantum
 mechanics of atoms, how a given protein molecule (consisting of many atoms)
 will fold into a biologically significant three dimensional shape.
 More relevant to this thesis, it is difficult to connect the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 theory of the standard model of sub-nuclear quarks and gluons (which are
 strongly interacting) with the very different looking effective theory
 of protons, neutrons and various mesons that is valid at nuclear scales.
 Similarly, it is difficult to accurately predict the behaviour of the Higgs
 field in the early universe which is filled with a very hot and dense plasma
 of many particles which may also be strongly interacting.
 In all cases the difficulty of the problem comes from the importance of
 a large number of degrees of freedom, or a strong coupling between degrees
 of freedom, or both.
 Only in the case of very simple systems or systems close to thermal equilibrium
 can their properties be determined with confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This inability to compute is not simply a philosophical difficulty for those
 seeking to shore up a reductionistic worldview.
 Neither is it simply a practical difficulty for those pure theoreticians
 who only want to better understand their mathematical models.
 It can also hinder efforts to learn real physics.
 For example consider the scenario of 
\emph on
electroweak baryogenesis
\emph default
, which is discussed in detail in the next section as a motivating physical
 example, though the methods discussed in the remainder of the thesis are
 broadly applicable.
 Briefly, it is believed that the Higgs field undergoes a phase transition
 at high temperatures which were reached in the early universe.
 The nature of this phase transition (e.g.
 whether it was first or second order, how much was the latent heat etc.)
 can have a profound impact on the amount of matter surviving to the present
 day universe
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_inset

.
 Hence, cosmological observations of the matter (baryon) density (as well
 as gravitational waves and primordial magnetic fields) have the potential
 to constrain this phase transition
\begin_inset Note Note

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is difficult to reliably tell whether a given particle physics
 model has a phase transition with given properties.
 For example, it is known that the standard model possesses a second order
 phase transition, but this finding was the result of a focused effort and
 could only be established using an expensive computational method (lattice
 Monte Carlo)
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It is practically impossible to scan the parameters of a theory of beyond
 standard model (BSM) physics using this method.
 In the BSM context one largely has to make do with a patchwork of semi-empirica
l curve fitting methods to connect the small scale physics (the fundamental
 parameters of the BSM model) with the large scale physics (phase transition
 thermodynamics and baryon yield).
 All of these methods require approximations which are somewhat suspect
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus, such cosmological observations are of limited usefulness for fundamental
 physics.
 New methods of calculation are required to bridge the gap between theory
 and experiment in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard model and the various BSM models are all examples 
\emph on
quantum field theories
\emph default
 (QFTs).
 Quantum field theory is the mathematical language of nature.
 Viewed in this light, much of the last century of theoretical physics can
 be seen as quantum field theory calculations performed in a variety of
 approximations.
 The most fruitful scheme so far is clearly perturbation theory in small
 couplings, which has seen wide use and great success.
 The classic example of a successful perturbation theory is the theory of
 quantum electrodynamics (QED): the quantum field theory of electrons and
 photons.
 In this theory the small parameter is the electric charge 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 of the electron, and observables are computed in a series expansion in
 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}+a_{1}e+a_{2}e^{2}+a_{3}e^{3}+\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the anomalous magnetic moment 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{e}$
\end_inset

 of the electron has been computed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{10}\right)$
\end_inset

 with the result in being in fantastic agreement with experiment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin{equation}

\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the numbers in parenthesis represent the uncertainties in the last
 digits (the theoretical prediction has uncertainties coming from several
 sources).
 These high order computations are typically laborious.
 For instance, the contribution of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aoyama2015"

\end_inset

 was to recompute a subset of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{10}\right)$
\end_inset

 terms with greater accuracy using Monte Carlo integration, which took 65
 days on a 128 core computer cluster.
 Despite the difficulty of improving the accuracy of perturbative predictions,
 perturbation theory is widely useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are important physical situations where naive perturbation
 theory fails.
 Electroweak baryogenesis is discussed in the next section as a concrete
 example of a real physics proposal where perturbation theory breaks down
 in several important steps of the computation.
 In such cases perturbation theory must be enhanced by resummation if it
 can be used at all.
 Resummation works by re-organising the terms of the perturbation series
 so that each term of the resummed series contains contributions from all
 orders of the original series.
 This re-organisation can manifest qualitatively important physical effects
 which are invisible to the original perturbation theory.
 For example, massless particles in thermal plasmas produce large loop correctio
ns which must be resummed, causing thermal mass generation and non-analyticities
 in thermodynamic functions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kapusta2006"

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, large logarithms can invalidate naive perturbation theory in
 problems involving disparate length or energy scales.
 Resummation of these logarithms leads to the renormalisation group running
 of coupling constants

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the need to go beyond naive perturbation theory is clear in many
 cases, 
\emph on
ad hoc
\emph default
 resummations are problematic because perturbation series are asymptotic
 in nature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and the re-organisation of the terms of an asymptotic series is mathematically
 questionable at best 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Systematic resummation schemes are required to guarantee consistency with
 the original non-perturbative theory.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs are a set of techniques (one for each 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1,2,3,\cdots$
\end_inset

) which can be thought of as generalisations of mean field theory which
 are (a) elegant, (b) general, (c) in principle exact, and (d) have been
 promoted for their applicability to non-equilibrium situations (see, e.g.,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Berges2015"

\end_inset

 and references therein for extensive discussion of all these points).
 Non-perturbative methods are essential in non-equilibrium QFT because secular
 terms in the time evolution equations invalidate perturbation theory.
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs with 
\begin_inset Formula $n>1$
\end_inset

 achieve the required non-perturbative resummation in a manifestly self-consiste
nt way which can be derived from first principles.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

In principle exact
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here means that the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA equations of motion are exactly equivalent to the original non-perturbative
 definition of the quantum field theory.
 The only necessary approximation is in the numerical solution of these
 equations.
 The resulting equations of motion are also useful in equilibrium because
 many-body effects are included self-consistently.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

General
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the methods are applicable in principle to any quantum field
 theory whatsoever (although in a theory with many fields or with large
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the resulting 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA could be very bulky).
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elegant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here means that few conceptually new elements are needed in the formulation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs in addition to the usual terms of textbook quantum field theory.
 The complication is mainly of a technical, not conceptual, nature.
 To the author's knowledge no other techniques satisfy all of these criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These properties make the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs compelling candidates for filling the gap between theory and experiment
 anywhere the problem is the inability to compute the behaviour of strongly
 interacting degrees of freedom or degrees of freedom which are out of thermal
 equilibrium.
 As such, they form the basis of this thesis.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "chap:chap2"

\end_inset

 of this thesis reviews 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs and then shows, in novel work, how they achieve a re-organisation
 of perturbation theory which is competitive with or exceeding more traditional
 resummation methods (using the 2PIEA and a toy model where exact results
 are available for the comparison).
 This success is explained in terms of the sensitivity of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA to analytic features of the exact solution which are invisible to perturbat
ion theory.
 The remainder of the thesis focuses on one of the major shortcomings of
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEAs â€“ their poor handling of symmetries â€“ and efforts to overcome it.

 The symmetry group of a model determines what types (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

representations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of particles may appear, as well as governing the form of the interactions
 and the conservation laws of the model.
 In the simplest case symmetries are 
\emph on
global
\emph default
, i.e.
 the same symmetry transformation applies everywhere in spacetime.
 In more complicated theories such as the standard model the symmetries
 are 
\emph on
gauge symmetries
\emph default
, meaning that independent symmetry transformations can be applied at each
 event in spacetime without altering the physics.
 The most important situation phenomenologically is the case of 
\emph on
spontaneously broken continuous symmetries
\emph default
.
 In this case the symmetry is not actually broken, merely hidden because
 there is an interaction which causes a ground state which behaves non-trivially
 under the symmetry to be energetically preferred.
 The classic example is the ferromagnet: the underlying dynamics is rotationally
 symmetric, but there is an interaction which tends to align the spins of
 neighbouring atoms in the ferromagnet, causing the ground state to be one
 with all spins aligned.
 This ground state violates the underlying rotational symmetry and a hypothetica
l microscopic physicist living inside the ferromagnet may take a long time
 to notice that there is no such thing as a preferred direction in space.
 This situation is schematically depicted in Figure

It is well known that for every type of matter particle (electron, proton,
 neutron, quarks etc.) there is a corresponding antiparticle with the same
 mass and opposite charge.
 This is now understood to be a consequence of combining the principles
 of special relativity and quantum mechanics, which requires that antiparticles
 exist and have closely related properties to the corresponding particles.
 This is a very robust result, requiring only basic physical principles,
 and it is satisfied by SM.
 Further, the standard cosmological model of the universe with a cosmological
 constant and cold dark matter (
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

CDM) predicts that the early universe was in a very hot and dense state,
 where the maximum temperature that the universe reaches could be as high
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{12}\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 At extremely high temperatures the universe contains a plasma where particle
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

)/antiparticle (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

) pair creation and annihilation reactions such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gamma\leftrightarrow\psi\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

 are in equilibrium.
 As the universe expands it cools, and when the temperature drops below
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim m_{\psi}c^{2}/k_{B}$
\end_inset

 the creation reactions 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\gamma\to\psi\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

 become Boltzmann suppressed.
 However, the annihilation reaction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\bar{\psi}\to\gamma\gamma$
\end_inset

 remains efficient as long as the (thermally averaged) reaction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\sim\left\langle n\sigma v\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number density, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the annihilation cross section and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

 is the relative velocity, is more rapid than the Hubble expansion rate
 of the universe 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\dot{a}/a$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the scale factor.
 In this regime particle/antiparticle pairs are annihilated, depleting the
 number densities of both and temporarily slowing the cooling of the plasma.
 Once 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\lesssim H$
\end_inset

 the annihilation reactions shut off and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi,\bar{\psi}$
\end_inset

 effectively decouple from the plasma, a phenomenon known as

 After freeze out the

 (This story assumes that

\end_inset

 particles are stable for simplicity.) Thus one should expect the number
 density of any species to be determined by the mass, reaction rates and
 expansion history in the way described, allowing one to derive from a model
 of particle physics a prediction for the amount of matter and antimatter
 in the universe.

The simplest possible explanation for the observed

 However a net baryon number 
\begin_inset Formula $B\neq0$
\end_inset

 initial condition for the universe is implausible as a solution to this
 problem for several reasons.
 First, if cosmic inflation is indeed the solution to the horizon, flatness
 and monopole problems in cosmology this requires at least about 60 
\begin_inset Formula $e$

-folds of expansion which would greatly dilute any initial baryon asymmetry.
 Second, if baryon number conservation is violated by any beyond standard

The SM has all three of the necessary ingredients: 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 violating sphaleron processes come from the nonperturbative electroweak
 sector of the SM, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is maximally violated by the chiral fermion couplings of the weak interactions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 is violated by the complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
 mixing matrix in the quark sector, and the SM plasma could be driven out
 of equilibrium by the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).
 For sufficiently small Higgs mass the EWPT is a first order transition
 which proceeds by bubble formation, analogous to boiling water, a violent
 process that locally departs from thermal equilibrium at the bubble walls.
 It was within the realm of possibility then, before the late 1990s (when
 the LEP2 experiment began placing limits on the Higgs mass), that the SM
 alone could account for baryogenesis.
 However, it is now known that the Higgs mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{H}=126\ \mathrm{GeV}>72\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $72\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 is the critical point of the EWPT.
 For values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{H}$
\end_inset

 greater than the critical value the EWPT is a smooth crossover transition
 which does not depart from equilibrium.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{H}$
\end_inset

 is too large for the EWPT to depart from equilibrium, violating the second
 Sakharov condition.
 Further, detailed computations show that the 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 violating phase of the CKM matrix is many orders of magnitude too small
 to account for the observed BAU

 Of those only a handful are well motivated and provide decent prospects
 for experimental confrontation in the foreseeable future.
 These are the models that propose new particles at or below the electroweak
 scale.
 One prominent option is to include additional scalar fields that couple
 to the SM Higgs and strengthen the EWPT, and may also provide new sources
 of CP violation.
 Such scalars can come from supersymmetric (

 In leptogenesis models an

 The standard leptogenesis scenarios place the new fermions at a high scale

 There are also

 It is quite possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(1\right)_{B}\times U\left(1\right)_{L}$

It is an important consistency condition that the anomalies for all chiral
 currents coupled to gauge bosons vanish.
 Otherwise, unphysical polarisation states of gauge bosons would be created
 and unitarity constraints would be violated in scattering processes.
 If one computes the group theory factors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}\left[T^{a}\left\{ t^{b},t^{c}\right\} \right]$

To illustrate the mechanism of baryon number violation I will simplify the
 SM somewhat.
 It will turn out that the abelian field 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 plays no qualitative role in what follows, so I can take 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{W}\to0$
\end_inset

, or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $g'\to0$
\end_inset

, decoupling the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 field from the theory.
 I can also take 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{g}=1$
\end_inset

 and ignore the Higgs-Yukawa couplings of the fermions as these play no
 qualitative role.
 The mechanism of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 violation is topological in nature, invisible to perturbation theory.
 At zero temperature it proceeds by quantum tunnelling between gauge vacua
 with different topologies.
 A potential barrier separates these field configurations and the leading
 contribution to the transition rate at zero temperature comes from the
 semi-classical tunnelling trajectory called an 
\emph on
instanton
\emph default
, discovered by 't Hooft and Polyakov.
 Later, Kuzmin, Rubakov and Shaposhnikov argued that at finite temperature
 the transition proceeds by classical fluctuations 
\emph on
over the barrier
\emph default
 at a rate increasing exponentially with temperature, finally becoming unsuppres
sed entirely at sufficiently high temperature.
 The height of the barrier can be computed by finding the (unstable) configurati
on of the gauge and Higgs fields that maximises the energy atop the barrier.
 These configurations are called 
\emph on
sphalerons
\emph default
 and were discovered by Klinkhamer and Manton

 All of these states have zero energy.
 Choose the static gauge 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 for simplicity, implying 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(\vec{x},t\right)=U\left(\vec{x}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The vacuum configurations must be connectible by trajectories with finite
 action (any states separated by an infinite action are physically inaccessible,
 even by quantum tunnelling.) This sets the boundary condition 
\begin_inset Formula $U\to\text{const.}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\vec{x}\right|\to\infty$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 going to any constant matrix is acceptable, and all choices are physically
 equivalent).
 This boundary condition is the same as compactifying the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 by adding a point at infinity, resulting in a space topologically equivalent
 (homeomorphic) to the three-sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 But the group 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 is also homeomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be seen by writing a general matrix in 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a+id & b+ic\\
-b+ic & a-id
\end{array}\right)\in SU\left(2\right),
\]

\end_inset

for real 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,d$
\end_inset

 and noting that the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(U\right)=1$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This defines a three-sphere of unit radius.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $U:\left(\mathbb{R}^{3}\cup\infty\right)\to SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 is a mapping of three-spheres 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}\to S^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 These mappings fall into topologically distinct classes classified by the
 third homotopy group of the three-sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{3}\left(S^{3}\right)=\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

.
 The number 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}\in\pi_{3}\left(S^{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 associated in this way to a mapping is called 
\emph on
winding number
\emph default
 and counts the number of times the map 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 winds around the group 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Both real space and the group space are oriented so it makes sense to talk
 about negative winding numbers.
 Maps with the same winding number can be continuously deformed to each
 other by a 
\emph on
small gauge transformation
\emph default
, while 
\emph on

The Chern-Simons number of the vacuum configurations can be evaluated as
 follows.
 First rewrite the Chern-Simons current in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
K^{\mu} & =4\epsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}W_{\nu}^{a}\partial_{\alpha}W_{\beta}^{a}-4\epsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\frac{g}{3}\epsilon^{abc}W_{\nu}^{a}W_{\alpha}^{b}W_{\beta}^{c}\\

 & =-\frac{16}{3g^{2}}i\epsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\epsilon^{abc}\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\alpha}U\tau^{b}\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\beta}U\tau^{c}\right)\\
 & =-\frac{8}{3g^{2}}\epsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\alpha}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\beta}U\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish the last equality a useful identity is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\epsilon^{abc}\mathrm{Tr}\left(A\tau^{a}\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(B\tau^{b}\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(C\tau^{c}\right) & =-\frac{1}{4}i\mathrm{Tr}\left(A\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(B\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(C\right)+\frac{1}{4}i\mathrm{Tr}\left(A\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(BC\right)\\

 & -\frac{1}{2}i\mathrm{Tr}\left(ABC\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C\in SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

, which can be proven using the further useful identities 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}\left(\tau^{a}\tau^{b}\tau^{c}\right)=\frac{i}{4}\epsilon^{abc}$
\end_inset

 and the Fierz identity 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{ij}^{a}\tau_{kl}^{a}=-\frac{1}{4}\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}+\frac{1}{2}\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}$
\end_inset

.
 Applying this with 
\begin_inset Formula $A=U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U$
\end_inset

 etc.
 and noting that the antisymmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 kills all but the last term gives the desired result.
 Finally evaluate the Chern-Simons number
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{K} & =\frac{g^{2}}{32\pi^{2}}\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\ K^{0}\\
 & =-\frac{1}{12\pi^{2}}\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\ \epsilon^{0\nu\alpha\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\alpha}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\beta}U\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\ \frac{1}{6}\epsilon^{\nu\alpha\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\alpha}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\beta}U\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\ \frac{\partial^{3}\Omega}{\partial^{3}x},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where used 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon^{0\nu\alpha\beta}=\epsilon^{\nu\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,\alpha,\beta=1,2,3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{3}\Omega}{\partial^{3}x}\equiv\frac{1}{6}\epsilon^{\nu\alpha\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\alpha}UU^{\dagger}\partial_{\beta}U\right),
\]

\end_inset

is the natural 
\emph on
oriented
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $SU\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 invariant group volume element (the 
\emph on
Haar measure
\emph default
).
 The integral then measures the oriented volume swept out in the group as
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 varies over all space; and since the volume of the group is the volume
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 counts the number of times the full group is swept out as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 varies over all space.
 Thus I find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}=n_{w}$
\end_inset

, the Chern-Simons number is just the winding number of the gauge field
 configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gauge vacuum with nontrivial winding can be found by choosing
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\exp\left(-i\tau^{a}\frac{x^{a}}{r}f\left(r\right)\right),
\]

\end_inset

and noting the boundary conditions demand that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(0\right)=2\pi n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(\infty\right)=2\pi m$
\end_inset

 for integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n,m$
\end_inset

.
 I illustrate the calculation of the Chern-Simons number of this configuration
 because it is hard to find in the literature and it is only straightforward
 once one knows where to start.
 It is easiest to use the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{0}$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 rather than the form involving the group volume element.
 Also note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
K^{0} & \propto\epsilon^{0\nu\alpha\beta}\epsilon^{abc}\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\alpha}U\tau^{b}\right)\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\beta}U\tau^{c}\right)\\
 & =6\det\left[\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)\right],
\end{align*}

\end_inset

thinking of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 as a 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu,a$
\end_inset

 indices.
 After a bit of algebra I find
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)=-i\frac{1}{2}\frac{x^{a}}{r}\partial_{\nu}f-i\partial_{\nu}\left(\frac{x^{a}}{r}\right)\sin\left(\frac{f}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{f}{2}\right)+i\epsilon^{abc}\frac{x^{b}}{r}\partial_{\nu}\left(\frac{x^{c}}{r}\right)\sin^{2}\left(\frac{f}{2}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\left[\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)\right]=\frac{i}{4r^{2}}\left(1-\cos f\right)f',
\]

\end_inset

leading to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{K} & =-\frac{i}{2\pi^{2}}\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\det\left[\mathrm{Tr}\left(U^{\dagger}\partial_{\nu}U\tau^{a}\right)\right]\\
 & =-\frac{i}{2\pi^{2}}\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\frac{if'\left(1-\cos f\right)}{4r^{2}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}r\ f'\left(1-\cos f\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{2\pi}\left[f-\sin f\right]_{0}^{\infty}\\
 & =m-n.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus the basic winding configuration has 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that only the boundary values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 enter into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

, confirming the topological nature of the Chern-Simons number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bringing the argument together: there is an infinitude of gauge vacua characteri
sed by the topological invariant 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 If there is a transition from one gauge vacuum to another which changes
 the winding number by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta n_{w}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=\Delta L=\Delta\mathcal{K}=\Delta n_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 More generally 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=\Delta L=n_{g}\Delta\mathcal{K}=n_{g}\Delta n_{w}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}=n_{w}$
\end_inset

 only holds for vacuum states.
 For excited states 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 varies continuous and is not necessarily an integer.
 Thus I can sketch the potential energy along the

 Note that this figure is only illustrative.
 To find an honest expression for the potential energy one needs to develop
 a one parameter ansatz for the gauge and Higgs fields which passes through
 the vacuum and sphaleron field configurations at appropriate parameter
 values and compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{K}$
\end_inset

 and the energy of the field configuration as a function of the parameter.
 The resulting figure is somewhat arbitrary, depending on the choice of
 ansatz.
 Physically, there are many paths over the ridge in field space represented
 by the sphaleron.

The first line is the energy of the gauge field and the second line is the

 The functions

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(\rho\right)$

 can be found by extremizing the integral (numerically: analytical solutions
 are not known) and the resulting field profiles depend only on the ratio
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{2}/g^{2}$

 The energy can be written
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=\frac{4\pi v}{g}C\left(\frac{\lambda^{2}}{g^{2}}\right),

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $C\left(\lambda^{2}/g^{2}\right)$

 It's precise value is not important here, but 
\begin_inset Formula $C\sim\mathcal{O}\left(1-3\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{2}/g^{2}$
\end_inset

 Thus the height of the barrier at zero temperature is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\ \mathrm{TeV}$
\end_inset

 One can thus think of the sphaleron, very roughly, as an unstable bound
 configuration with of the order of 30 each of 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{+},W^{-},Z$
\end_inset

 and 10 Higgs particles in a region 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{-17}\ \mathrm{m}$

 across.
 In reality the sphaleron is a coherent state, not a particle number eigenstate,
 so this picture is at best qualitative.
 However, this illustrates that, while 
\begin_inset Formula $10\ \mathrm{TeV}$
\end_inset

 might not sound like a terribly high energy for modern colliders, sphalerons
 are difficult if not impossible to produce at collider experiments

 This latter assumption is justified by the fact that the baryon asymmetry

\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0$

 Between the upper and lower spinodal temperatures, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{+}>T>T_{-}=\frac{m_{h}}{\sqrt{2a}}\sim0.158v$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi\neq0$

 At the critical temperature

 the new minimum is degenerate with the minimum at

 At temperatures

 the broken phase is preferred and for

 the coefficient of

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\mathrm{eff}}$

 vanishes and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0$

 ceases to be a minimum of the effective potential altogether.
 The history of the universe in this scenario is as follows.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T>T_{+}$
\end_inset

 the electroweak symmetry is unbroken.
 As the universe expands the temperature drops to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\star}<T<T_{+}$
\end_inset

.
 In this regime bubbles of broken phase can form by thermal fluctuations
 but these are unstable and rapidly disappear.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T=T_{\star}$
\end_inset

 the interior of the bubbles of broken phase are degenerate with the unbroken
 phase, but there is an energy cost associated with the bubble walls that
 still renders them unstable.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{-}<T<T_{\star}$
\end_inset

 the broken phase has an energy advantage 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V=-V_{\mathrm{eff}}\left(\phi_{\mathrm{min}},T\right)$
\end_inset

 and a spherical bubble of broken phase has an energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=4\pi R^{2}\sigma-\frac{4\pi}{3}R^{3}\Delta V,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the surface tension of the bubble wall.
 The bubble will expand if it is larger than the critical size 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\star}=2\sigma/\Delta V$
\end_inset

.
 The rate of bubble formation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\sim\exp\left(-E_{\star}/T\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\star}=\frac{16\pi}{3}\frac{\sigma^{3}}{\Delta V^{2}}$
\end_inset

 is the energy of the critical bubble (I will not attempt to estimate the
 prefactor here, the general problem is unsolved).
 Bubble nucleation becomes cosmologically significant when this rate exceeds
 the Hubble rate, which requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 drop sufficiently below 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\star}$
\end_inset

.
 At this time bubbles begin to form and expand, eventually filling the universe.
 The volume fraction of broken phase as a function of time and the completion
 time of the phase transition can be computed from a simple macroscopic
 model once a few plasma parameters are known, namely the latent heat, surface
 tension and wall velocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The wall velocity in turn can be calculated using a hydrodynamic theory
 given the friction on the bubble wall, at least for sufficiently large

 It is the job of a microphysical model to calculate the wall friction,
 latent heat and surface tension of a phase transition bubble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The friction on bubble walls is the result of particles in the unbroken
 phase scattering on the bubble wall and being driven out of local thermal
 equilibrium.
 It is this breaking of local thermal equilibrium which satisfies the Sakharov
 criterion for baryogenesis in EWBG models.
 If the scatterings also violate 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

, e.g.
 by preferentially scattering left handed particles, then a net asymmetry
 of left handed particles builds up in the unbroken phase in front of the
 wall (balanced by an opposite right handed asymmetry which passes through
 the wall).
 The left handed particles outside the wall bias sphaleron transitions to
 produce a net baryon number.
 It is important that in the broken phase the sphaleron transitions are
 turned off, otherwise they will wash out the net asymmetry.
 This requires that the phase transition be sufficiently strong, typically
 taken to mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi/T_{\star}\gtrsim1$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi$
\end_inset

 is the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 between the phases at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\star}$
\end_inset

, but it is not trivial to determine how strong is really strong enough.
 Indeed, a proper determination of the washout factor, beyond a few conservative
 estimates, is one of the main outstanding problems in EWBG

The qualitative reason 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 violation leads to baryogenesis is as follows.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 is violated in quark-wall scattering such that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}+\bar{q}_{R}$
\end_inset

 reflect more readily than 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{R}+\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 I also temporarily 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sphalerons.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{R}+\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

 build up in front of the bubble wall (recall that Higgs-Yukawa interactions
 change fermion chirality) while a compensating 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 asymmetry passes through into the broken phase.
 There is no baryon asymmetry at this stage, and if it were not for sphaleron
 transitions no asymmetry would be generated: though the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{R}+\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

 tend to reflect from the bubble wall they will all eventually pass through,
 certainly by the time the broken phase fills all of space.
 Now turn sphalerons back on.
 Sphalerons only act on the 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 particles, converting 
\begin_inset Formula $3n_{f}\bar{q}_{L}\to n_{f}l_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3n_{f}q_{L}\to n_{f}\bar{l}_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 The rate of the former process, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=+1$
\end_inset

, exceeds the rate of the latter, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta B=-1$
\end_inset

, since there are more 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{q}_{L}$
\end_inset

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{L}$
\end_inset

 in front of the wall.
 Hence a net baryon number is generated in front of the bubble wall.
 Clearly the net baryon asymmetry produced by this mechanism depends on
 a number of factors: how strong is the 
\begin_inset Formula $CP$
\end_inset

 violation in the reflection/transmission coefficients, how far do reflected
 particles diffuse into the plasma ahead of the bubble wall and for how
 long, what is the rate of sphaleron transitions in the plasma ahead of
 and behind the bubble wall and how fast are other processes besides sphalerons
 which tend to wash out CP asymmetries (without producing B or L asymmetries)?
 The current practice for quantitative calculations is to calculate bubble
 wall reflection/transmission coefficients using a non-equilibrium quantum
 transport theory or semi-classical Boltzmann equation, using bubble wall
 velocities obtained from a hydrodynamic treatment and ignoring the back-reactio
n of the generated asymmetries on the bubble wall; perform lattice Monte
 Carlo calculations of the sphaleron rate, in one of a few simplified models,
 in equilibrium at various temperatures to calibrate a semi-empirical formula
 which hopefully applies out of equilibrium to the required accuracy; and
 combine these elements in a network of continuity equations which are integrate
d numerically to find the final baryon (and lepton) asymmetry

 only ever one minimum of the effective potential.
 The upper and lower spinodal temperature are equal to the critical temperature
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\pm}=T_{\star}$

 As the temperature decreases the universe smoothly evolves from an unbroken
 to a broken phase and there is never any bubble nucleation.
 As a result the plasma never departs from local thermal equilibrium and
 there is no opportunity for EWBG.

In this report I have discussed the essential physics behind electroweak
 baryogenesis scenarios and given two examples of nonequilibrium quantum
 field theory techniques applied to simple scalar/fermion theories.
 It was not possible to explore these topics in any great depth in this
 report.
 Indeed the research literature on baryogenesis and nonequilibrium QFT has
 thousands of papers.
 The work presented here is admittedly a somewhat eclectic mix of topics
 taken from these fields, and the connections between them may not be obvious.
 Here I draw out the main lessons learned in this investigation, highlight
 current outstanding problems and potential directions for future work and
 their significance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obvious major problem facing EWBG scenarios is the order of the electroweak
 phase transition.
 It is necessary for the transition to proceed through bubble formation
 as in a first order transition, and also that the scalar field behind the
 bubble wall be sufficiently large (a measure of the strength of the phase
 transition) that sphaleron processes are effectively shut off, lest they
 erase the baryon asymmetry that was so painstakingly created.
 We have already seen that lattice methods are required for the EWPT in
 the SM with 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{h}=125\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 and that these studies indicates that there is only a smooth crossover
 transition.
 In this case there is no bubble nucleation and the plasma never departs
 far enough from equilibrium to satisfy the Sakharov criteria.
 Thus it is necessary to extend the SM to obtain EWBG.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most straightforward approach to strengthening the EWPT is adding new
 scalar fields which are strongly coupled to the Higgs.
 In the MSSM the stops (top quark superpartners), particularly the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{t}_{R}$
\end_inset

, and the second Higgs doublet are suitable candidates, although current
 LHC data favours a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

split
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mini-split
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scenario where the stops are relatively heavy compared to the weak scale
 and hence decouple from the EWPT-relevant physics (a discussion of the
 most current constraints on natural SUSY can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Evans2013"

\end_inset

).
 Thus the standard view in the recent literature is that EWBG in the MSSM
 is nearly ruled out (see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Chung2013"

\end_inset

 for a discussion in the MSSM and more generally); however, recent lattice
 Monte Carlo studies using dimensional reduction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kajantie1996,Laine2012,Laine2013"

\end_inset

 suggest that the EWPT in the light stop scenario is much stronger than
 the perturbative estimates previously employed, and the tension with LHC
 data is further reduced if the 
\begin_inset Formula $125\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 Higgs can decay into 
\begin_inset Formula $m\lesssim60\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 neutralinos

 Thus to the author's knowledge EWBG within the MSSM remains worthy of considera
tion, at least until the end of run 2 of the LHC.

Non-supersymmetric extensions are possible as well, the most popular being
 the two Higgs doublet models (
\noun on
2HDM

).
 Though having two Higgs doublets like the MSSM, these models can differ
 significantly from the MSSM in terms of phenomenology because of the absence
 of coloured scalars and the relaxation of SUSY constraints on the scalar
 potential (i.e., the 2HDM potential does not have to be derivable from a
 holomorphic superpotential).
 This extra freedom carries the danger of generating large flavour changing
 neutral currents (
\noun on
FCNC

 This problem is bypassed by imposing a discrete symmetry on the theory
 to restrict the Yukawa couplings, resulting in four discrete classes of
 2HDM corresponding to the possible charge assignments under the discrete

 Altogether there are 65 of them: one dimension 5 term that generates Majorana

 Of all of these operators, only one affects the Higgs potential: the dimension
 six term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\right)^{3}$
\end_inset

 Thus a conservative, and largely model independent, exploration of BSM
 modifications to the Higgs potential can be achieved by taking as the Higgs
 potential
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V\left(\Phi\right)=\mu^{2}\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi+\frac{\lambda^{2}}{2}\left(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{\Lambda^{2}}\left(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\right)^{3}.

EWBG with this potential has been investigated in

\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda\sim500-800\ \mathrm{GeV}$
\end_inset

 gives a strong first order phase transition for the physical Higgs mass
 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{h}=125\ \mathrm{GeV}$

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\right)^{3}$

 unless the new physics generates other dimension 6 operators at the same

In summary we have seen that it is easy to strengthen the EWPT in BSM models
 of current phenomenological interest.
 This strongly motivates the experimental search for exotic Higgs decays

 However, questions can be raised about the computation of the phase transition
 thermodynamics.
 A conceptual question of great practical import is the gauge dependence
 of this theory, which is relevant in the Higgs theory because an expectation
 value of a gauge-variant quantity like 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 is physically meaningless.
 Two methods are available to check the gauge dependence of the result:
 redo the computation in a general class of gauges such as 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\xi}$
\end_inset

 gauge and check the dependence on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 parameter, or develop a formulation using only manifestly gauge invariant
 quantities such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi$
\end_inset

.
 An example of the first method is the jump of the order parameter at the
 critical temperature, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}/T_{c}$
\end_inset

, calculated by standard techniques in the SM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Patel2011"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\phi_{c}}{T_{c}}=\frac{3-\xi^{3/2}}{48\pi\lambda}\left(2g_{2}^{3}+\left(g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}\right)^{3/2}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the Higgs quartic coupling and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1},g_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(1\right),SU\left(2\right)_{L}$
\end_inset

 gauge couplings respectively (note the normalisation convention for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is different from ours!).
 Note the spurious gauge dependence of this quantity.
 Indeed by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=3^{2/3}$
\end_inset

 the order parameter can be made to vanish! Similarly, calculations of the
 sphaleron rate and washout factors are gauge dependent and so far only
 lattice results are theoretically solid, but these have only been done
 in a small number of cases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Morrissey2012"

\end_inset

.
 As a result it is difficult to say whether a given phase transition is
 indeed strong enough to avoid washing out a baryon asymmetry.
 The vast majority of treatments ignore these issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of the second method is the lattice Monte Carlo method, where
 it is necessary to use gauge invariant order parameters from the outset
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Moore1997,Bodeker1999"

\end_inset

 for examples showing how gauge invariant observables can be judiciously
 chosen to extract the desired physics).
 Unfortunately it is infeasible to implement and interpret lattice computations
 for every scenario in every model of interest, so it remains valuable to
 develop appropriately gauge invariant perturbative methods.
 Also, lattice methods can only be straightforwardly applied to equilibrium
 problems.
 Thus real time methods which allow an extension to non-equilibrium situations
 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 have manifestly good gauge invariance properties are particularly valuable.
 The chief difficultly with the development of perturbative methods for
 the phase transition is the infrared divergences associated with the Higgs
 and gauge bosons near the critical point.
 Physically, soft modes of these fields become highly occupied.
\end_layout

 is a tractable numerical problem, though analytical results are available

, but the evaluation of the functional determinants ranges from very difficult
 to hopeless.
 Thus one typically guesses the prefactor based on scaling and dimensional
 analysis and attempts to validate this guess by comparison to lattice Monte
 Carlo simulations.
 So far this program has only been carried out for a small number of benchmark
 models.
 In cases of phenomenological interest for EWBG where multiple scalar fields
 are participating in the phase transition the nucleation rate is in principle
 a straightforward extension of these standard results, but the computational
 difficulty increases with the complexity of the scalar sector.
 Often one finds thin wall results applied without the validity of the approxima
tion being checked.

\begin_layout Standard
Another point worth noting is that there is no real time description of
 bubble nucleation.
 The situation is analogous to a particle tunnelling through a barrier in
 a quantum mechanical system: one does not ask about the time evolution
 of the particle while the particle is under the barrier.
 Instead one finds that the wavefunction leaks through the barrier; the
 particle itself presumably makes some kind of quantum leap.
 Similarly a real time description of bubble nucleation must involve the
 wave-functional 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi\left[\phi\right]$
\end_inset

 (or density matrix functional 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\rho}\left[\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

) which is initially, say, a Gaussian centred on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{+}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi\sim\exp\left[-\int\mathrm{d}^{3}x\ \frac{\mu}{2}\left(\phi-\phi_{+}\right)^{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 but which gradually develops a component on the other side of the barrier.
 It is not clear what, if anything, such a description would yield of practical
 relevance.
 In particular, decoherence between branches of the wave-functional with
 different histories of bubble nucleation is probably large, but the author
 knows of no discussion of this topic in the literature.
 A more important practical question is the gauge dependence of the formalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After critical bubbles nucleate they expand.
 Since the scalar fields involved are large it is expected that the evolution
 of the bubble is classical from this point on, and indeed this approximation
 is universally made in the literature.
 In principle one should check to what degree the state resulting from the
 nucleation process is in fact a coherent state, and allow for the possibilities
 of quantum particle creation and charge fractionalisation on the bubble
 wall 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 a macroscopic size.

 It is assumed that not only is the Higgs field in a coherent state, but
 that the plasma is well described by quasi-particles with near equilibrium
 distribution functions (in the rest frame of the plasma)

\begin_inset Formula $v$

 is the plasma velocity in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 direction which is taken to be perpendicular to the wall.
 The equation of motion for the mean value of the Higgs field is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\square\phi+\frac{\partial F}{\partial\phi}+\sum_{i}\frac{\mathrm{d}m_{i}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}\phi}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}^{3}p}{\left(2\pi\right)^{3}2E_{i}}\delta f_{i}\left(p\right)=0,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the finite temperature effective potential for the Higgs and the third
 term is the friction term, which is due to the deviation of the particle
 distribution functions from equilibrium.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta f_{i}$
\end_inset

 are found by solving a network of Boltzmann equations for the particle
 transport in the vicinity of the bubble wall.
 This program is very difficult (and questions about the applicability of
 Boltzmann equations remain), and has only been carried out in any detail
 in the SM and MSSM.
 In other models one computes a simple phenomenological friction coefficient
 and then calibrates it relative to the SM value which has been computed
 much more accurately.
 Once the phenomenological friction coefficient is obtained the bubble expansion
 is a hydrodynamic problem which has essentially been solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boltzmann equations can be derived from first principles quantum transport
 equations (Kadanoff-Baym equations) under the assumption of weak gradients
 and the lack of memory effects or coherence.
 Coherence can arise, for example, as a result of flavour oscillations,
 in which case the treatment must be extended from single particle distribution
 functions to two particle density matrices.
 Recent advances have applied quantum transport techniques to those species
 involved in the creation of CP violation and baryon number, with the finding
 that resonant flavour oscillations can lead to an enhancement of the asymmetry
 produced, however the bulk plasma properties are still treated semi-classically

Baryon production is largely dependent on the production of CP violation
 in fermion scattering off bubble walls and the diffusion of the asymmetric
 species into the plasma ahead of the bubble wall, which must be subsonic
 for such diffusion to happen

 The faster an asymmetric species diffuses, the longer it remains ahead
 of the bubble wall, and the longer sphalerons have to convert it into a
 net baryon asymmetry.
 Thus a solid understanding of the scattering and transport of plasma particles
 in the bubble region is essential to a reliable EWBG calculation.
 Recent progress has achieved this, up to some small open questions, in
 the context of the MSSM (for a review see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Konstandin2013"

\end_inset

).
 Open questions regard the validity of some of the approximations used in
 deriving Boltzmann equations, then continuity equations, from the Kadanoff-Baym
 equations.
 In particular these are the gradient expansion - usually truncated to lowest
 non-trivial order, the quasiparticle approximation (the applicability of
 distribution functions), the fluid approximation (distribution functions
 have the equilibrium form with spacetime varying velocity, temperature
 and chemical potential) and weak coupling.
 Also reactions which are very fast compared to the diffusion time are treated
 by constraining the chemical potentials of the species involved, while
 those very slow compared to the diffusion time are ignored.
 Only those reactions which take place on a similar time scale to the diffusion
 time require detailed treatment.
 These techniques have not yet seen wide application to BSM models other
 than the MSSM, although the SM with the dimension six term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\right)^{3}$
\end_inset

, a scalar singlet SM extension, 2HDM (Types I and II), MSSM, and NMSSM
 are each briefly discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Konstandin2013"

\end_inset

.
 The general finding is that apart from the MSSM, the main portion of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 asymmetry generated in each model is due to a semi-classical force term
 and that the possibility of resonant enhancement, the topic of much recent
 debate, is unimportant.
 The Kadanoff-Baym framework is a solid foundation, thus I view the problem
 of fermion transport in EWBG as a problem where incremental model-dependent
 progress is an important possibility, but no major advances should be expected.

\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{\left(3\right)}\left(\boldsymbol{0}\right)=\left(2\pi\right)^{-3}\int_{\boldsymbol{x}}\mathrm{e}^{i\boldsymbol{x}\cdot\boldsymbol{0}}=\left(2\pi\right)^{-3}\mathrm{V}$

 Note that when

 In this case one can see that the commutator vanishes by setting

 To show that this holds in all frames one needs to show that the integration
 measure is in fact Lorentz invariant, as the exponentials are manifestly

 Since

 it is possible to break the finite time evolution into a succession of

 and take the

\end_inset

 limit such that each step represents an infinitesimal time evolution.
 Formally this is done by repeatedly inserting resolutions of the identity
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 This means that there is an inertial coordinate system where the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{k}$

 One can further assume, without loss of generality, that the hypersurfaces

 That is,

In order to make practical use of the functional integral it is necessary
 to have some way of characterising the initial and final states, handling
 the overall normalisation and evaluating the integral itself.
 Each of these typically require regularisation to handle divergences and
 renormalisation to express the input parameters in terms of physical observable
s.
 The way all of these are implemented depends on the physical application
 being considered.

For example, the setting of most particle physics is vacuum field theory.
 One is usually interested in the scattering of a small number of particles
 which only interact in a small spacetime region.
 Long before and after the interaction the particles are effectively free,
 so the initial and final states can be approximated by free particle states
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim a_{\boldsymbol{k}_{1}}^{\dagger}a_{\boldsymbol{k}_{2}}^{\dagger}\cdots a_{\boldsymbol{k}_{n}}^{\dagger}\Ket{\text{vac}}$
\end_inset

 and the appropriate observable is the S-matrix element.
 The

 free particle states to the vacuum-to-vacuum transition matrix elements
 of a time ordered product of interacting fields (a 
\emph on
correlation

 or 
\emph on

).
 The essential idea of the LSZ formulae is that, while the free field operators
 create and destroy single particles, interacting fields have some amplitude
 to create and destroy multi-particle states.
 Nevertheless, multi-particle wave packets spread differently than single
 particle wave packets, so that the single particle contributions can be
 isolated and related to the asymptotic free particle states.
 The Green functions can be evaluated by using, essentially, the formulae
 of the previous section.
 However it is necessary to characterise the initial and final physical
 vacuum state and handle the overall normalisation.
 The

This assumes that the vacuum state is non-degenerate and separated by a
 finite spectral gap from any excited states.
 In particular, this implies that this formalism for vacuum field theory
 is strictly speaking invalid for massless particles.
 Yet, massless particles can be handled in this formalism provided one takes
 care of infrared (i.e.
 low energy) divergences and computes inclusive cross sections, i.e.
 including processes with the emission of extra soft particles in the final
 state which are invisible in realistic detectors.
 A detailed treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this thesis,

 The normalisation factor is taken care of by noting that

 an undisturbed vacuum remains vacuum.

Note that there is a vacuum contribution to the pressure as well.
 The fact that this contribution is equal to the negative of the vacuum
 energy is in fact a consequence of Lorentz invariance

 Thus the pressure (i.e.

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{U}\left(t,t_{0}\right)$

 As usual 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{U}\left(t_{2},t_{1}\right)$

\end_inset

but, for

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathrm{T}}$

Further, both branches of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$

 the segment of the evolution from

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}\left(t\right)\to\hat{O}\left(z\right)$

 The imaginary branch of the contour is called the

 The similarity of this result to the usual vacuum field theory formula

 assumptions have been made about the initial/final state or spectrum of
 the theory.
 This greatly extends the applicability of the formalism compared to the
 usual vacuum field theory.
 Despite this, much of the technical machinery of the vacuum theory, including
 path integrals, Feynman diagrams, effective actions and renormalisation,
 can be carried over with suitable modifications for contour time ordering
 as opposed to regular time ordering.
 Difficulties come from the extra degrees of freedom (fields on the backward
 branch of the contour), the explicit appearance of memory effects, and
 choosing a 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}_{M}$

The main objects of interest are the correlation functions of field operators,
 i.e.
 objects like
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\left(x,y\right)=-i\left\langle \mathrm{T}_{C}\left[\hat{\phi}\left(x\right)\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right]\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

in a scalar field theory.
 Now all the time coordinates run on the time contour 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 There are nine possibilities for the time arguments of the Green function:
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be on either of the forward, backward or Matsubara branches of the
 contour independently.
 This leads to the definition of 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\emph on

\emph default
 Green functions, with real time arguments, for each case.
 There is also the possibility for a singular part, proportional to a contour
 delta function 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{C}\left(z_{1},z_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These components and two

\begin_layout Standard
The origin of some of the names can be seen by visualising the function
 arguments on the time contour.
 For example, the lesser function is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)=-i\left\langle \hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\hat{\phi}\left(x\right)\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

i.e.
 the second argument appears to the left of the first in the matrix element,
 regardless of the relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 So the lesser function orders the fields 
\emph on
as if 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}<y^{0}$
\end_inset

, even if it is not.
 The hook functions are similarly visual.
 Consider the left hook function 
\begin_inset Formula $\lhook\Delta\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

: the left argument is on the Matsubara (vertical) branch and the right
 argument is on a real time (horizontal) branch (it does not matter which
 one since the contour ordering is the same in both cases).
 The contour delta function is defined so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z'\ \delta_{C}\left(z,z'\right)f\left(z'\right)=f\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 as usual.
 The only nontrivial reduction to an ordinary delta function is when (taking
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 for simplicity) 
\begin_inset Formula $z=-i\tau$
\end_inset

 lies on the Matsubara branch:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{C}\mathrm{d}z'\ \delta_{C}\left(-i\tau,z'\right)f\left(z'\right)=f\left(-i\tau\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The only contribution can come from 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 on the Matsubara branch, so substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $z'=-i\tau'$
\end_inset

 giving
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{-i\beta\hbar}\mathrm{d}\left(-i\tau'\right)\delta_{C}\left(-i\tau,-i\tau'\right)f\left(-i\tau'\right)=f\left(-i\tau\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{C}\left(-i\tau,-i\tau'\right)=i\delta\left(\tau-\tau'\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When working with the Keldysh components it is convenient to have identities
 for the reduction of frequently occuring convolutions and products of contour
 time functions to their components.
 These identities are called 
\emph on
Langreth rules
\emph default
 and are summarised in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Langreth-rules"

\end_inset

.
 These identities are proved in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Stefanucci2013"

\end_inset

 chapter 5.
 The most common use of these identities is in the reduction of equations
 of motion for contour ordered Green functions to equations for real times
 functions.
 For example, if a scalar field Green function obeys a Dyson equation of
 the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\square_{x}\Delta\left(x,y\right)=i\delta_{C}\left(x,y\right)+\int_{z}\Sigma\left(x,z\right)\Delta\left(z,y\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\square_{x}=\partial_{\mu}^{\left(x\right)}\partial^{\left(x\right)\mu}$
\end_inset

 and the self energy function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is also defined on the time contour, the Langreth rules show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{<}$
\end_inset

 obeys (suppressing arguments)
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\square_{x}\Delta^{<}=\Sigma^{<}\cdot\Delta^{A}+\Sigma^{R}\cdot\Delta^{<}+\rhook\Sigma\star\lhook\Delta,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

an equation suitable for numerical solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Green functions contain the physical information of the theory.
 This can be seen explicitly in the simplifying case of free fields where
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=0$
\end_inset

 and the Dyson equation can be solved simply by Fourier transform.
 Writing
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{\left(a\right)}\left(x,y\right)=\int_{p}\mathrm{e}^{-ip\left(x-y\right)}\Delta^{\left(a\right)}\left(p\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 denotes the Keldysh component, one has 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Calzetta1988"

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta^{\mathrm{T}}\left(p\right) & = & \frac{1}{p^{2}-m^{2}+i\epsilon}-2\pi if\left(p\right)\delta\left(p^{2}-m^{2}\right),\\
\Delta^{<}\left(p\right)=\Delta^{>}\left(-p\right) & = & -2\pi i\left[\Theta\left(p^{0}\right)+f\left(p\right)\right]\delta\left(p^{2}-m^{2}\right),\\
\Delta^{\tilde{\mathrm{T}}}\left(p\right) & = & -\frac{1}{p^{2}-m^{2}-i\epsilon}-2\pi if\left(p\right)\delta\left(p^{2}-m^{2}\right),
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{<}\left(p\right)=\Delta^{>}\left(-p\right)$
\end_inset

 follows by Hermiticity of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}$
\end_inset

, and the fact that the same function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 is found on all of the right hand sides is due to the fact that the commutator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\hat{\phi}\left(x\right),\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 is a c-number, so its expectation value 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\left\langle \left[\hat{\phi}\left(x\right),\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right]\right\rangle =\Delta^{>}\left(x,y\right)-\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 is independent of the state.
 By considering the anticommutator 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\left\{ \hat{\phi}\left(x\right),\hat{\phi}\left(y\right)\right\} =\Delta^{>}\left(x,y\right)+\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 one finds that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 must be real and even.
 Another constraint is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{xy}h^{\star}\left(x\right)i\Delta^{<}\left(x,y\right)h\left(y\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

 for all real functions 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, which implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, an equilibrium computation shows that there 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 is just the Bose-Einstein occupation number of the mode 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 naturally has the interpretation of a statistical distribution function
 which can be extended to arbitrary states.
 Thus knowledge of the Green function is equivalent to knowledge of the
 statistical distribution function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other observables of the theory are simply related to the Green functions
 since they are polynomials in the fields and their derivatives.
 For example, in a theory with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 scalar fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,\cdots,N$
\end_inset

, with an 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 symmetry, the conserved 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 currents are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
j_{\mu}^{A}=i\left\langle \phi_{a}T_{ab}^{A}\overleftrightarrow{\partial_{\mu}}\phi_{b}\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ab}^{A}=-T_{ba}^{A}$
\end_inset

 is a generator of rotations which has been written in a basis of the 
\begin_inset Formula $A=1,\cdots,N\left(N-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 independent generators and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\overleftrightarrow{\partial_{\mu}}g\equiv f\left(\partial_{\mu}g\right)-\left(\partial_{\mu}f\right)g$
\end_inset

.
 This can be written in terms of the Green function as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
j_{\mu}^{A}\left(x\right)=iT_{ab}^{A}\left.\left(\partial_{\mu}^{\left(y\right)}-\partial_{\mu}^{\left(x\right)}\right)\left\langle \phi_{a}\left(x\right)\phi_{b}\left(y\right)\right\rangle \right|_{y\to x}=T_{ab}^{A}\left.\left(\partial_{\mu}^{\left(x\right)}-\partial_{\mu}^{\left(y\right)}\right)\Delta_{ab}^{>}\left(x,y\right)\right|_{y\to x}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly, if the theory has a quartic coupling the energy-momentum tensor
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu}=\left\langle \partial_{\mu}\phi_{a}\partial_{\nu}\phi_{a}-\eta_{\mu\nu}\left(\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\rho}\phi_{a}\partial^{\rho}\phi_{a}-\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\phi_{a}\phi_{a}-\frac{\lambda}{4!}\left(\phi_{a}\phi_{a}\right)^{2}\right)\right\rangle ,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which can be written in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\left(4\right)}=\left\langle \mathrm{T}_{C}\left[\phi_{a}\phi_{b}\phi_{c}\phi_{d}\right]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

UPDATE WHEN THE REST OF THE INTRODUCTION HAS BEEN WRITTEN!!!!
\end_layout

\end_inset

This chapter has reviewed quantum field theory focusing on the functional
 integral formalism.
 It has been shown that a common formula for the generating functional can
 be used for scattering, thermal equilibrium and generic non-equilibrium
 problems by specifying a choice of time contour.
 The fundamental objects of field theory are the Green functions which can
 be straightforwardly connected to physical observables such as densities,
 currents and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap2"

\end_inset

 introduces the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-particle irreducible effective action (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA) techniques with an emphasis on their application to non-perturbative
 quantum field theory.
 This includes of review of the standard theory surrounding the methods
 and concludes with a novel investigation into the analytic properties of
 the solution of the 2PIEA in a toy model which can be compared to the exact
 solution and contrasted with other non-perturbative techniques.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap3"

\end_inset

 begins the consideration of symmetries in the thesis by introducing the
 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 scalar field theory which forms the basis of the remainder of the work.
 The Ward identities for the theory (which encode the symmetries of the
 theory in effective action language) are derived and it is shown that the
 expected identities no longer hold for truncations of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA.
 This result is known in the literature but is derived here in a way which
 is, to the author's knowledge, new.
 The 2PIEA is then solved in the Hartree-Fock approximation demonstrating
 this result explicitly.
 A contrast is then drawn between these results and those of the external
 propagator method and large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 method.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap4"

\end_inset

 introduces the symmetry improved 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA (SI-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA) as a means of overcoming the difficulty posed by violations of symmetries
 in truncated 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA.
 The novel work in this chapter is an extension of the symmetry improvement
 known in the literature from 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(2\right),O\left(4\right)\to O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 and from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(\hbar^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 SI-2PIEA to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(\hbar^{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 SI-3PIEA.
 Additionally, several ambiguities in the original symmetry improvement
 procedure are identified and addressed.
 The renormalisation theory of these actions is discussed and solutions
 are presented in the Hartree-Fock approximation, as well as a few checks
 of the basic field theoretical consistency of the new actions.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap5"

\end_inset

 introduces a novel technique called soft symmetry improvement (SSI) aimed
 at overcoming the difficulties of the SI-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA.
 The SSI-2PIEA is derived, renormalised and solved in the Hartree-Fock approxima
tion.
 It is shown that the method is sensitive to the way the infinite volume
 / low temperature limit is taken and there are three limiting cases: a
 trivial reduction to the unimproved 2PIEA, a reduction to the SI-2PIEA,
 and a novel limit which possess some unusual features which are discussed.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:chap6"

\end_inset

 studies for the first time the non-equilibrium aspects of the SI-2PIEA
 by formulating the linear response theory for a system governed by the
 SI-2PIEA being driven away from equilibrium by a weak external perturbation.
 It is shown that the SI-2PIEA, and by a simple extension all SI-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

PIEA, are inconsistent with the linear response approximation.
 Finally, chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Discussion"

\end_inset

 is the discussion chapter drawing everything together and pinpointing direction
s for future work.
 Some derivations and results concerning the renormalisation theory which
 are inessential to the main flow of the text are collected in the appendices
