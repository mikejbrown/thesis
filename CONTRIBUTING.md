# So you want to contribute?

First of all, thank you!

Second of all, since a scientific PhD thesis is not your typical open source project I have some rather strict contributing guidelines.

1. I will happily consider any Github _pull request_ if
    - The thesis version is `>= v1.0.0`,
    - the suggested changes do not affect any of the scientific conclusions of the thesis,
    - the suggested changes consist only of spelling/grammar/formatting improvements and/or improvements to the supporting software which remain end-results-reproducible.
2. If you wish to see any larger changes, particularly any changes which might affect the scientific results of the thesis, please initiate an e-mail conversation with me!

With these restrictions in mind I am happy to consider any community feedback that might be around.

Cheers,

Michael Brown
