  abstract      = {Nonperturbative approximation schemes based on two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective actions provide an important means for our current understanding of (non-)equilibrium quantum field theory. A remarkable property is their renormalizability, since these approximations involve selective summations to infinite perturbative orders. In this paper, we show how to renormalize all n-point functions of the theory, which are given by derivatives of the 2PI-resummed effective action $\Gamma$[$\phi$] for scalar fields $\phi$. This provides a complete description in terms of the generating functional for renormalized proper vertices, which extends previous prescriptions in the literature on the renormalization for 2PI effective actions. The importance of the 2PI-resummed generating functional for proper vertices stems from the fact that the latter respect all symmetry properties of the theory and, in particular, Goldstone's theorem in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is important in view of the application of these techniques to gauge theories, where Ward identities play a crucial role. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We further present a single simple proof of Wick's theorem that is at the same time valid in all these flavors of many-body theory. It arises simply as a solution of the equations of the Martin-Schwinger hierarchy for the noninteracting many-particle Green's function with appropriate boundary conditions.

Further we prove that one can define an effective action functional in terms of the self-consistent propagators which is invariant under the operation of the same symmetry group representation as the classical action. The requirements for this theorem to hold true are the same as for perturbative approximations: The symmetry has to be realized linearly on the fields and it must be free of anomalies, i.e., there should exist a symmetry conserving regularization scheme. In addition, if the theory is renormalizable in Dyson's narrow sense, it can be renormalized with counter terms which do not violate the symmetry.},

A self-consistently complete description determines the functional for arbitrarily high n to a given order in the expansion. We point out an equivalence hierarchy for nPI effective actions, which allows one to obtain a self-consistently complete result in practice. The method is applied to a SU(N) gauge theory with fermions up to four-loop or O(g\^{}6) corrections. For non-equilibrium we discuss the connection to kinetic theory. The leading-order on-shell results in g can be obtained from the three-loop effective action approximation, which already includes in particular all diagrams enhanced by the Landau Pomeranchuk Migdal effect. Furthermore, we compare the effective action approach with Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. By construction, SD equations are expressed in terms of loop diagrams including both classical and dressed vertices, which leads to ambiguities of whether classical or dressed ones should be employed at a given truncation order. We point out that these problems are absent using effective action techniques. We show that a wide class of truncations of SD equations cannot be obtained from the nPI effective action. In turn, our results can be used to resolve SD ambiguities of whether classical or dressed vertices should be employed at a given truncation order.},

Typically, and in particular when numerical solutions are demanded, these Kadanoff-Baym equations are restricted to Gaussian initial states. However, physical initial states are non-Gaussian correlated initial states. In particular, renormalizability requires the initial state to feature n-point correlations that asymptotically agree with the vacuum correlations at short distances. In order to identify physical nonequilibrium initial states, it is therefore a precondition to describe the vacuum correlations of the interacting theory within the nonequilibrium framework. In this paper, Kadanoff-Baym equations for non-Gaussian correlated initial states describing vacuum and thermal equilibrium are derived from the 2PI effective action. A diagrammatic method for the explicit construction of vacuum and thermal initial correlations from the 2PI effective action is provided. We present numerical solutions of Kadanoff-Baym equations for a real scalar Phi\^{}4 quantum field theory which take the thermal initial 4-point correlation as the leading non-Gaussian correction into account. We find that this minimal non-Gaussian initial condition yields an approximation to the complete equilibrium initial state that is quantitatively and qualitatively significantly improved as compared to Gaussian initial states.},

  abstract      = {The chiral phase transition is investigated within the framework of thermal field theory using the O(N) linear sigma model as an effective theory. We calculate the thermal effective potential by using the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism of composite operators. The thermal effective potential is calculated for N=4 involving as usual the sigma and the three pions, and in the large-N approximation involving N-1 pion fields. In both cases, the system of the resulting gap equations for the thermal effective masses of the particles has been solved numerically, and we have investigated the evolution of the effective potential. In the N=4 case, there is indication of a first-order phase transition, while in the large N approximation the phase transition appears as second-order. In this analysis, we have ignored quantum fluctuations and have used the imaginary time formalism for calculations. We have extended our calculation in order to include the full effect of two loops in the calculation of the effective potential. In this case, the effective masses are momentum dependent. In order to perform the calculations, we found the real time formalism to be convenient. We have calculated the effective masses of pions at the low-temperature phase and we found a quadratic dependence on temperature, in contrast to the Hartree case, where the mass is proportional to temperature. The sigma mass was investigated in the presence of massive pions, and we found a small deviation compared to the Hartree case. In all cases, the system approaches the behaviour of the ideal gas at the high temperature limit.},

This model, which we refer to as the nuNMSM, can readily satisfy or escape the constraints on warm dark matter from the Lyman-alpha forest and other small scale structure. However, it requires a particular hierarchy of Majorana masses and Yukawa couplings without an obvious origin. We show that the hierarchical parameters of the nuNMSM can arise from symmetries broken at or near the Planck scale for two specific examples of this model: one in which phi helps stabilize the electroweak vacuum through a scalar threshold effect and one in which phi is a light inflaton. Both examples require a complex phi and have several experimental signatures that are distinct from the nuMSM. These signatures include additional dark radiation that is relativistic at both primordial nucleosynthesis and CMB decoupling and, for the former, a large invisible branching ratio of the Higgs.},

A systematic approach to constructing a large class of models for Majorana neutrinos may be founded upon a list of gauge-invariant effective operators -- formed from quarks, leptons and the Higgs doublet -- that violate lepton-number conservation by two units. By opening up these operators in all possible ways consistent with some minimality assumptions, a complete catalogue of a class of minimal radiative neutrino mass models may be produced. In this paper we present an analysis of Feynman diagram topologies relevant for the ultra-violet completions of these effective operators and collect these into a simple recipe that can be used to generate radiative neutrino mass models. Since high mass-dimension effective operators are suppressed by powers of the scale of new physics, many of the resulting models can be meaningfully tested at the Large Hadron Collider.},

The mechanism of production is due to oscillations between "dark" Majorana neutrino and one of the Majorana's which has relatively large Yukawa couplings ("bright" Majorana neutrino). The transition of "bright" Majorana into a "dark" one is nonadiabatic. We point out on the similarity with the Landau-Zener transition regime.

We derive an interesting joint condition on $\backslash$sin$\backslash$theta\_\{13\} and the absolute neutrino mass scale that can be tested in future neutrino oscillation experiments. In the limit of hierarchical heavy RH neutrino spectrum (HL), we strengthen the previous result that $\backslash$delta-leptogenesis is only very marginally allowed, even when the production from the two heavier RH neutrinos is taken into account. An improved experimental upper bound on $\backslash$sin$\backslash$theta\_\{13\} and (or) an account of quantum kinetic effects could completely rule out this option in the future.

After data unblinding, the number of neutrinos observed towards the Sun was found to be compatible with background expectations. The \$90\backslash\%\$ CL upper limits in terms of spin-dependent and spin-independent WIMP-proton cross-sections are derived and compared to predictions of two supersymmetric models, CMSSM and MSSM-7. The ANTARES limits are competitive with those obtained by other neutrino observatories and are more stringent than those obtained by direct search experiments for the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross-section.},

Both methods lead to the same result: the energy and decay rate of the quasiparticles are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the retarded self-energy respectively.

The baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated by the mechanism via flavor oscillation of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos which are responsible to masses of active neutrinos confirmed by various experiments. We present the kinetic equations for the matrix of densities of leptons which describe the generation of asymmetries. Especially, the momentum dependence of the matrix of densities is taken into account. By solving these equations numerically, it is found that the momentum distribution is significantly distorted from the equilibrium one, since the production for the modes with lower momenta \$k \backslash ll T\$ (\$T\$ is the temperature of the universe) is enhanced, while suppressed for higher modes. As a result, the most important mode for the yields of sterile neutrinos as well as the baryon asymmetry is \$k \backslash simeq 2 T\$, which is smaller than < k > inferred from the thermal average. The comparison with the previous works is also discussed.},

We present the regions of parameter space which can yield successful predictions for cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the observed relic density for the neutralino LSP, and successful baryogenesis constrained by collider measurements, such as the recent Higgs mass bound, branching ratios of rare, flavour violating decays, and the invisible Z decay width.

  abstract      = {The inverse seesaw mechanism allows the neutrino masses to be generated by new physics at an experimentally accessible scale, even with O(1) Yukawa couplings. In the inverse seesaw scenario, the smallness of neutrino masses is linked to the smallness of a lepton number violating parameter. This parameter may arise radiatively. In this paper, we study the cosmological implications of two contrasting radiative inverse seesaw models, one due to Ma and the other to Law and McDonald. The former features spontaneous, the latter explicit lepton number violation. First, we examine the effect of the lepton-number violating interactions introduced in these models on the baryon asymmetry of the universe. We investigate under what conditions a pre-existing baryon asymmetry does not get washed out. While both models allow a baryon asymmetry to survive only once the temperature has dropped below the mass of their heaviest fields, the Ma model can create the baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis. Then we investigate the viability of the dark matter candidates arising within these models, and explore the prospects for direct detection. We find that the Law/McDonald model allows a simple dark matter scenario similar to the Higgs portal, while in the Ma model the simplest cold dark matter scenario would tend to overclose the universe.},

These flavours have different Standard-Model Yukawa couplings, which induce flavour-sensitive scattering processes and thermal dispersion relations. Kinetic equilibrium, which is rapidly established and maintained via gauge interactions, allows to simplify these equations to kinetic equations for the matrix of lepton charge densities. In performing this simplification, we notice that the rapid flavour-blind gauge interactions damp the flavour oscillations of the leptons. Leptogenesis turns out to be in the parametric regime where the flavour oscillations are overdamped and flavour decoherence is mainly induced by flavour sensitive scatterings. We solve the kinetic equations for the lepton number densities numerically and show that they interpolate between the unflavoured and the fully flavoured regimes within the intermediate parametric region, where neither of these limits is applicable.},

It is particularly emphasised how the procedure of real intermediate state subtraction familiar from the Boltzmann approach is realised within the CTP framework; and we show how in time-independent situations, no lepton asymmetry emerges, in accordance with the CPT-theorem. The CTP approach provides new quantum statistical corrections from evaluating the loop integrals. These lead to an enhancement of the asymmetry that is originating from the Bose statistics of the Higgs particles. To quantify this effect, we define and evaluate an effective CP-violating parameter. We also solve the kinetic equations and show explicitly that the new quantum statistical corrections can be neglected in the strong washout regime, while, depending on initial conditions, they can be very sizable for weak washout.},

It describes the dependence of the free energy on an infrared cutoff for the quantum or thermal fluctuations. Non-perturbative solutions follow from approximations to the general form of the coarse-grained free energy or effective average action. They interpolate between the microphysical laws and the complex macroscopic phenomena. Our approach yields a simple unified description for O(N)-symmetric scalar models in two, three or four dimensions, covering in particular the critical phenomena for the second-order phase transitions, including the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and the critical behavior of polymer chains. We compute the aspects of the critical equation of state which are universal for a large variety of physical systems and establish a direct connection between microphysical and critical quantities for a liquid-gas transition. Universal features of first-order phase transitions are studied in the context of scalar matrix models. We show that the quantitative treatment of coarse graining is essential for a detailed estimate of the nucleation rate. We discuss quantum statistics in thermal equilibrium or thermal quantum field theory with fermions and bosons and we describe the high temperature symmetry restoration in quantum field theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we explore chiral symmetry breaking and the high temperature or high density chiral phase transition in quantum chromodynamics using models with effective four-fermion interactions.},

While in thermal equilibrium typically a Euclidean formulation is adequate, nonequilibrium properties require real-time descriptions. For quantum systems specified by a given density matrix at initial time, a generating functional for real-time correlation functions can be written down using the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path. This can be used to construct a nonequilibrium functional renormalization group along similar lines as for Euclidean field theories in thermal equilibrium. Important differences include the absence of a fluctuation-dissipation relation for general out-of-equilibrium situations. The nonequilibrium renormalization group takes on a particularly simple form at a fixed point, where the corresponding scale-invariant system becomes independent of the details of the initial density matrix. We discuss some basic examples, for which we derive a hierarchy of fixed point solutions with increasing complexity from vacuum and thermal equilibrium to nonequilibrium. The latter solutions are then associated to the phenomenon of turbulence in quantum field theory.},

The DM candidate is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), and the usual WIMP scenario is slightly extended to accommodate baryogenesis, which is accomplished around the time of DM freeze-out. We construct an effective field theory that encompasses a quite general class of models which implement the WIMPy baryogenesis. Under some reasonable, simplifying assumptions, we show that a good portion of the parameter space is allowed for these models, after experimental constraints are taken into account.

As an application of this general formalism, we study flavour effects in a scenario of resonant leptogenesis (RL) and obtain the flavour-covariant evolution equations for heavy-neutrino and lepton number densities. This provides a complete and unified description of RL, capturing three distinct physical phenomena: (i) the resonant mixing between the heavy-neutrino states, (ii) coherent oscillations between different heavy-neutrino flavours, and (iii) quantum decoherence effects in the charged-lepton sector. To illustrate the importance of this formalism, we numerically solve the flavour-covariant rate equations for a minimal RL model and show that the total lepton asymmetry can be enhanced up to one order of magnitude, as compared to that obtained from flavour-diagonal or partially flavour off-diagonal rate equations. Thus, the viable RL model parameter space is enlarged, thereby enhancing further the prospects of probing a common origin of neutrino masses and the baryon asymmetry in the Universe at the LHC, as well as in low-energy experiments searching for lepton flavour and number violation. The key new ingredients in our flavour-covariant formalism are rank-4 rate tensors, which are required for the consistency of our flavour-mixing treatment, as shown by an explicit calculation of the relevant transition amplitudes by generalizing the optical theorem. We also provide a geometric and physical interpretation of the heavy-neutrino degeneracy limits in the minimal RL scenario. Finally, we comment on the consistency of various suggested forms for the heavy-neutrino self-energy regulator in the lepton-number conserving limit.},

  abstract      = {The universe cools down monotonically following its expansion.This generates a sequence of phase transitions. If a second order phase transition happens during the radiation dominated era with a charged order parameter, spinodal unstabilities generate large numbers of charged particles. These particles hence produce magnetic fields.We use out of equilibrium field theory methods to study the dynamics in a mean field or large N setup.The dynamics after the transition features two distinct stages: a spinodal regime dominated by linear long wave length instabilities, and a scaling stage in which the non-linearities and backreaction of the scalar fields are dominant. This second stage describes the growth of horizon sized domains. We implement a formulation based on the non equilibrium Schwinger-Dyson equations to obtain the spectrum of magnetic fields that includes the dissipative effects of the plasma. We find that large scale magnetogenesis is efficient during the scaling regime. Charged scalar field fluctuations with wavelengths of the order of the Hubble radius induce large scale magnetogenesis via loop effects.The leading processes are:pair production, pair annihilation and low energy bremsstrahlung, these processes while forbidden in equilibrium are allowed strongly out of equilibrium. The ratio between the energy density on scales larger than L and that in the background radiation r(L,T)= rho\_B(L,T)/rho\_\{cmb\}(T) is r(L,T) \~{} 10\^{}\{-34\} at the Electroweak scale and r(L,T) \~{} 10\^{}\{-14\} at the QCD scale for L sim 1 Mpc. The resulting spectrum is insensitive to the magnetic diffusion length and equipartition between electric and magnetic fields does not hold. We conjecture that a similar mechanism could be operative after the QCD chiral phase transition.},

In condensed matter we describe the phenomenological approach based on the Time Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) description. After a general discussion of the main experimental and theoretical features of phase ordering kinetics and the description of linear (spinodal) instabilities we introduce the scaling hypothesis and show how a dynamical correlation length emerges in the large N limit in condensed matter systems. The large N approximation is a powerful tool in quantum field theory that allows the study of non-perturbative phenomena in a consistent manner. We study the exact solution to the dynamics after a quench in this limit in Minkowski space time and in radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker Cosmology. There are some remarkable similarities between these very different settings such as the emergence of a scaling regime and of a dynamical correlation length at late times that describe the formation and growth of ordered regions. In quantum field theory and cosmology this length scale is constrained by causality and its growth in time is also associated with coarsening and the onset of a condensate. We provide a density matrix interpretation of the formation of defects and the classicalization of quantum fluctuations.},

We survey these phase transitions, highlighting the equilibrium and non-equilibrium effects as well as their observational and cosmological consequences. We discuss the current theoretical and experimental programs to study phase transitions in QCD and nuclear matter in accelerators along with the new results on novel states of matter as well as on multi- fragmentation in nuclear matter. A critical assessment of similarities and differences between the conditions in the early universe and those in ultra- relativistic heavy ion collisions is presented.

This model describes the general features of neutrino mixing and relaxation via charged currents in a medium. The reduced density matrix and the non-equilibrium effective action that describes the propagation of neutrinos is obtained by integrating out the bath degrees of freedom. We obtain the dispersion relations, mixing angles and relaxation rates of ``neutrino'' quasiparticles. The dispersion relations and mixing angles are of the same form as those of neutrinos in the medium, and the relaxation rates are given by \$\backslash Gamma\_1(k) = \backslash Gamma\_\{ee\}(k) \backslash cos\^{}2\backslash theta\_m(k)+\backslash Gamma\_\{\backslash mu\backslash mu\}(k)\backslash sin\^{}2\backslash theta\_m(k)   ; \backslash Gamma\_2(k)= \backslash Gamma\_\{\backslash mu\backslash mu\}(k) \backslash cos\^{}2\backslash theta\_m(k)+\backslash Gamma\_\{ee\}(k)\backslash sin\^{}2\backslash theta\_m(k) \$ where \$\backslash Gamma\_\{\backslash alpha\backslash alpha\}(k)\$ are the relaxation rates of the flavor fields in $\backslash$emph\{absence\} of mixing, and \$\backslash theta\_m(k)\$ is the mixing angle in the medium.

  abstract      = {We discuss theoretical and phenomenological aspects of two-Higgs-doublet extensions of the Standard Model. In general, these extensions have scalar mediated flavour changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by experiment. Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing scalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In particular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated, including the so-called type I and type II models as well as lepton-specific and inert models. Type III models are then discussed, where scalar flavour changing neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by either specific ansatze for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of family symmetries. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in these models. Next we turn to the role of symmetries in the scalar sector. We discuss the six symmetry-constrained scalar potentials and their extension into the fermion sector. The vacuum structure of the scalar potential is analysed, including a study of the vacuum stability conditions on the potential and its renormalization-group improvement. The stability of the tree level minimum of the scalar potential in connection with electric charge conservation and its behaviour under CP is analysed. The question of CP violation is addressed in detail, including the cases of explicit CP violation and spontaneous CP violation. We present a detailed study of weak basis invariants which are odd under CP. A careful study of spontaneous CP violation is presented, including an analysis of the conditions which have to be satisfied in order for a vacuum to violate CP. We present minimal models of CP violation where the vacuum phase is sufficient to generate a complex CKM matrix, which is at present a requirement for any realistic model of spontaneous CP violation.},

  abstract      = {We use the Gross-Neveu model in 2<d<4 as a simple fermionic example for Weinberg's asymptotic safety scenario: despite being perturbatively nonrenormalizable, the model defines an interacting quantum field theory being valid to arbitrarily high momentum scales owing to the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point. Using the functional renormalization group, we study the UV behavior of the model in both the purely fermionic as well as a partially bosonized language. We show that asymptotic safety is realized at non-Gaussian fixed points in both formulations, the universal critical exponents of which we determine quantitatively. The partially bosonized formulation allows to make contact to the large-Nf expansion where the model is known to be renormalizable to all-orders. In this limit, the fixed-point action as well as all universal critical exponents can be computed analytically. As asymptotic safety has become an important scenario for quantizing gravity, our description of a well-understood model is meant to provide for an easily accessible and controllable example of modern nonperturbative quantum field theory.},

The model that realises this scenario is known as Neutrino Minimal Standard Model ($\backslash$nu MSM). In this article we give a comprehensive summary of all known constraints in the $\backslash$nu MSM, along with a pedagogical introduction to the model. We present the first complete quantitative study of the parameter space of the model where no physics beyond the $\backslash$nu MSM is needed to simultaneously explain neutrino oscillations, dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. This requires to track the time evolution of left and right handed neutrino abundances from hot big bang initial conditions down to temperatures below the QCD scale. We find that the interplay of resonant amplifications, CP-violating flavour oscillations, scatterings and decays leads to a number of previously unknown constraints on the sterile neutrino properties. We furthermore re-analyse bounds from past collider experiments and big bang nucleosynthesis in the face of recent evidence for a non-zero neutrino mixing angle $\backslash$theta\_\{13\}. We combine all our results with existing constraints on dark matter properties from astrophysics and cosmology. Our results provide a guideline for future experimental searches for sterile neutrinos. A summary of the constraints on sterile neutrino masses and mixings has appeared in arXiv:1204.3902 [hep-ph]. In this article we provide all details of our calculations and give constraints on other model parameters.},

It relies on the formation of small bubbles of the symmetric phase behind the bubble wall, in the broken phase, due to the heating of the plasma as the wall passes by. We apply the mechanism to a model in which the Higgs field is coupled to several singlets, and find that enough baryon asymmetry is generated for reasonable values of the parameter space.},

  abstract      = {Recently, the Planck satellite found a larger and most precise value of the matter energy density, that impacts on the present values of other cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, the present cluster abundances and the age of the Universe. The existing tension between Planck determination of these parameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct measurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this paper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base LambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the radiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest cosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the primordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the preference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile neutrino masses. This increases the tension between cosmological and short baseline neutrino oscillation data that favor a sterile neutrino with the mass of around 1 eV. For the case of degenerate massive neutrinos, we find that the discrepancies with direct determinations of the Hubble constant, the present cluster abundances and the age of the Universe are alleviated at \~{} 1.3 sigma for all leptonic asymmetric models. We also find \~{}2 sigma statistical evidence of the preference of cosmological data for the normal neutrino hierarchy. This is more evident for the case of cosmological models involving leptonic asymmetry and three massive neutrino species. We conclude that the current cosmological data favor the leptonic asymmetric extension of the base LambdaCDM model and normal neutrino mass hierarchy over the models with additional sterile neutrino species and/or inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.},

In this work, we perform a detailed analysis, including all dominant two-loop finite temperature corrections to the Higgs effective potential, as well as the non-trivial effects proceeding from the mixing in the stop sector, to define the region of parameter space for which electroweak baryogenesis can happen. The limits on the stop and Higgs masses are obtained by taking into account the experimental bounds on these quantities, as well as those coming from the requirement of avoiding dangerous color breaking minima. We find for the Higgs mass \$m\_h \backslash simlt 105\$ GeV, while the stop mass may be close to the present experimental bound and must be smaller than, or of order of, the top quark mass. These results provide a very strong motivation for further non-perturbative analysis of the electroweak phase transition, as well as for the search for Higgs and stop particles at the LEP and Tevatron colliders.},

  abstract      = {Electroweak baryogenesis is an attractive scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe as its realization depends on the presence at the weak scale of new particles which may be searched for at high energy colliders. In the MSSM it may only be realized in the presence of light stops, and with moderate or small mixing between the left- and right-handed components. Consistency with the observed Higgs mass around 125 GeV demands the heavier stop mass to be much larger than the weak scale. Moreover the lighter stop leads to an increase of the gluon-gluon fusion Higgs production cross section which seems to be in contradiction with indications from current LHC data. We show that this tension may be considerably relaxed in the presence of a light neutralino with a mass lower than about 60 GeV, satisfying all present experimental constraints. In such a case the Higgs may have a significant invisible decay width and the stop decays through a three or four body decay channel, including a bottom quark and the lightest neutralino in the final state. All these properties make this scenario testable at a high luminosity LHC.},

We found that (i) Higgcision in 2HDMs can be performed efficiently by using only 4 parameters including the charged Higgs contributions to the Higgs couplings to two photons, (ii) the differences among various types of 2HDMs are very small with respect to the chi-square fits, (iii) \$\backslash tan\backslash beta\$ is constrained to be small, (iv) the \$p\$-values for various fits in 2HDMs are worse than that of the standard model.

  abstract      = {Recently, the ATLAS and CMS detectors have discovered a bosonic particle which, to a reasonable degree of statistical uncertainty, fits the profile of the Standard Model Higgs. One obvious implication is that models which predict a significant departure from Standard Model phenomenology, such as large exotic (e.g., invisible) Higgs decay or mixing with a hidden sector scalar, are already ruled out. This observation threatens the viability of electroweak baryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to or mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these constraints, we propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition and impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as the MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the measurement of a 125 GeV Higgs. Models which rely on tree-level effects from a light singlet are also restricted by invisible decay and mixing constraints. Moreover, we find that the parametric region favored by electroweak baryogenesis often coincides with an enhanced symmetry point with a distinctive phenomenological character. In particular, enhancements arising through an approximate continuous symmetry are phenomenologically disfavored, in contrast with enhancements from discrete symmetries. We also comment on the excess of diphoton events observed by ATLAS and CMS. We note that although Higgs portal models can accommodate both enhanced diphoton decay and a strongly first order electroweak phase transition, the former favors a negative Higgs portal coupling whereas the latter favors a positive one, and therefore these two constraints are at tension with one another.},

This article updates the BBN predictions for the light elements using the new value of Omega\_b determined by Planck, as well as an improvement of the nuclear network and new spectroscopic observations. While there is no major modification, the error bars of the primordial D/H abundance (2.67+/-0.09) x 10\^{}\{-5\} are narrower and there is a slight lowering of the primordial Li/H abundance (4.89\^{}+0.41\_-0.39) x 10\^{}\{-10\}.

In this limit the <Phi> mean field and two-point correlation function <Phi Phi> evolve together as a self-consistent closed Hamiltonian system, characterized by a Gaussian density matrix. The static part of the effective Hamiltonian defines the True Effective Potential U\_eff for configurations far from thermal equilibrium. Numerically solving the time evolution equations for energy densities corresponding to a quench in the unstable spinodal region, we find results quite different from what might be inferred from the equilibrium free energy ``effective'' potential F. Typical time evolutions show effectively irreversible energy flow from the coherent mean fields to the quantum fluctuating modes, due to the creation of massless Goldstone bosons near threshold. The plasma frequency and collisionless damping rate of the mean fields are calculated in terms of the particle number density by a linear response analysis and compared with the numerical results. Dephasing of the fluctuations leads also to the growth of an effective entropy and the transition from quantum to classical behavior of the ensemble. In addition to casting some light on fundamental issues of nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, the general framework presented in this work may be applied to a study of the dynamics of second order phase transitions in a wide variety of Landau-Ginsburg systems described by a scalar order parameter.},

Thus, WIMPy baryogenesis models naturally accommodate weak-scale dark matter. Furthermore, an extension of the WIMP miracle simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry and the correct dark matter abundance. The models we present have the further feature that they create the baryon number asymmetry at the weak scale, thereby avoiding the problems in some models of baryogenesis associated with high reheat temperatures in supersymmetric theories. Some of these models yield observable consequences in ongoing and future experiments.},

  abstract      = {We perform an extensive survey of non-standard Higgs decays that are consistent with the 125 GeV Higgs-like resonance. Our aim is to motivate a large set of new experimental analyses on the existing and forthcoming data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The explicit search for exotic Higgs decays presents a largely untapped discovery opportunity for the LHC collaborations, as such decays may be easily missed by other searches. We emphasize that the Higgs is uniquely sensitive to the potential existence of new weakly coupled particles and provide a unified discussion of a large class of both simplified and complete models that give rise to characteristic patterns of exotic Higgs decays. We assess the status of exotic Higgs decays after LHC Run 1. In many cases we are able to set new nontrivial constraints by reinterpreting existing experimental analyses. We point out that improvements are possible with dedicated analyses and perform some preliminary collider studies. We prioritize the analyses according to their theoretical motivation and their experimental feasibility.

The plasma is assumed to be homogeneous in a coordinate space but the momentum distribution of plasma constituents is arbitrary. Using the technique of generating functional, we derive the Slanov-Taylor identities and one of them expresses the ghost Green's function, which we look for, through the gluon one. As an application, the Green's function of ghosts is used to compute the gluon polarization tensor in the hard loop approximation which appears to be automatically transverse, as required by the gauge invariance.},

In the first part, several aspects of charged-lepton flavor violation are discussed, especially its sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics. The discussion concentrates mostly on rare processes involving muons and electrons. In the second part, the status of the conservation of total lepton number is discussed. The discussion here concentrates on current and future probes of this apparent law of Nature via searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, which is also the most sensitive probe of the potential Majorana nature of neutrinos.},

For large scales, for structures beyond 100 kpc, WDM and CDM yield identical results which agree with observations. For intermediate scales, WDM gives the correct abundance of substructures. Inside galaxy cores, below 100 pc, N-body classical physics simulations are incorrect for WDM because at such scales quantum effects are important for WDM. Quantum calculations (Thomas-Fermi approach) provide galaxy cores, galaxy masses, velocity dispersions and density profiles in agreement with the observations. All evidences point to a dark matter particle mass around 2 keV. Baryons, which represent 16\% of DM, are expected to give a correction to pure WDM results. The detection of the DM particle depends upon the particle physics model. Sterile neutrinos with keV scale mass (the main WDM candidate) can be detected in beta decay for Tritium and Renium and in the electron capture in Holmiun. The sterile neutrino decay into X rays can be detected observing DM dominated galaxies and through the distortion of the black-body CMB spectrum. The effective number of neutrinos, N\_\{eff\} measured by WMAP9 and Planck satellites is compatible with two Majorana sterile neutrinos in the eV mass scale. The WDM contribution to N\_\{eff\} is of the order \~{}0.01 and therefore too small to be measurable by CMB observations. So far, not a single valid objection arose against WDM.},

Simulations that include well known Standard Model physics give a good fit to the data. This leaves little room for new physics and makes these astrophysical objects a good laboratory for testing models beyond the Standard Model. It has already been suggested that white dwarfs might provide some evidence for the existence of axions. In this work we study the constraints that the white dwarf luminosity function puts on physics beyond the Standard Model involving new light particles (fermions or bosons) that can be pair-produced in a white dwarf and then escape to contribute to its cooling. We show, in particular, that we can severely constrain the parameter space of models with dark forces and light hidden sectors (lighter than a few tens of keV). The bounds we find are often more competitive than those from current lab searches and those expected from most future searches.},

  abstract      = {Neutrinos are the only particles in the Standard Model of particle physics that have only been observed with left handed chirality to date. If right handed neutrinos exist, they could be responsible for several phenomena that have no explanation within the Standard Model, including neutrino oscillations, the baryon asymmetry of the universe, dark matter and dark radiation. After a pedagogical introduction, we review recent progress in the phenomenology of right handed neutrinos. We in particular discuss the mass ranges suggested by hints for neutrino oscillation anomalies and dark radiation (eV), sterile neutrino dark matter scenarios (keV) and experimentally testable theories of baryogenesis (GeV to TeV). We summarize constraints from theoretical considerations, laboratory experiments, astrophysics and cosmology for each of these.},

Our method applies to a generic quantum field, coupled to a collection of background fields and sources, in a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. The analysis is based on analytical solutions to the full Kadanoff-Baym equations, using the WKB approximation. This is in contrast to previous derivations of kinetic equations that rely on similar physical assumptions, but obtain approximate equations of motion from a gradient expansion in momentum space. We show that the system follows a generalized Boltzmann equation whenever the WKB approximation holds. The generalized Boltzmann equation, which includes off-shell transport, is valid far from equilibrium and in a time dependent background, such as the expanding universe.},

The violation of left lepton numbers and the corresponding violation of the baryon number due to sphaleron processes in symmetric phase is taken into account as well. Assuming the Chern-Simons wave configuration of the seed hypercharge field, we get the estimates of baryon and lepton asymmetries evolved from the primordial right electron asymmetry existing alone as partial asymmetry at T > T\_RL. One finds a strong dependence of the asymmetries on the Chern-Simons wave number. We predict a nonzero chiral asymmetry $\backslash$Delta $\backslash$mu = $\backslash$mu\_e\_R - $\backslash$mu\_e\_L $\backslash$neq 0 in this scenario evolved down to the EWPT moment that can be used as an initial value for the Maxwellian field evolution after EWPT.},

  abstract      = {The Higgs effective potential in the Standard Model (SM), calculated perturbatively, generically suffers from infrared (IR) divergences when the (field-dependent) tree-level mass of the Goldstone bosons goes to zero. Such divergences can affect both the potential and its first derivative and become worse with increasing loop order. In this paper we show that these IR divergences are spurious, we perform a simple resummation of all IR-problematic terms known (up to three loops) and explain how to extend the resummation to cure all such divergences to any order. The method is of general applicability and would work in scenarios other than the SM. Our discussion has some bearing on a scenario recently proposed as a mechanism for gauge mediation of scale breaking in the ultraviolet, in which it is claimed that the low-energy Higgs potential is non-standard. We argue that all non-decoupling effects from the heavy sector can be absorbed in the renormalization of low-energy parameters leading to a SM-like effective theory.},

Although the ultraviolet power counting in this approximation scheme is identical to that of the unapproximated quantum field theory, this approximation is not renormalizable. The leading cause of this non-renormalizability is the breakdown of Weinberg's theorem in this approximation. We also discuss some practical implications of this negative result for simulations that employ this approximation scheme, and we speculate about a possible modification of the classical statistical approximation in order to systematically subtract the leading residual divergences.},

We perform such study in different bubble expansion regimes, namely deflagrations, detonations, hybrids (steady states) and runaway solutions (accelerating wall), without relying on a specific particle physics model. We compute the efficiency of the transfer of vacuum energy to the bubble wall and the plasma in all regimes. We clarify the condition determining the runaway regime and stress that in most models of strong first-order phase transitions this will modify expectations for the gravity wave signal. Indeed, in this case, most of the kinetic energy is concentrated in the wall and almost no turbulent fluid motions are expected since the surrounding fluid is kept mostly at rest.},

Such models typically give rise to significant MET, top quarks and/or high object multiplicity, and we show that having even one of these signatures generally results in stringent limits. We also identify, among models that lack these signatures, the few gaps in coverage remaining, and propose search strategies to close these gaps. Our results are general and independent of the details of the spectrum, assumptions about minimality, R-parity, etc. Our analysis strategy should remain applicable when the LHC moves to higher energy. Central to our argument are ATLAS and CMS searches for many jets and low MET, a proposed lepton + many jets search, an ATLAS search for 6-7 high-pT jets, and a reexamination of the control and signal regions of the CMS black hole search.},

  abstract      = {In this thesis the two-particle-irreducible (2PI) formalism is investigated with several applications, particular emphasis on renormalizability. In the O(N) symmetric scalar quantum field theory formulated with auxiliary fields it is pointed out that, statements recently appeared in the literature which raised doubts on renormalizability, are wrong. Counterterms are constructed in details in the NLO of the large-N expansion. The renormalizability is demonstrated at the same level of the approximation also with eliminating the auxiliary field. In the one component $\backslash$phi\^{}4 model (at T=0) a method using renormalization conditions is developed, which gives directly finite equations for the 1- and 2-point functions. This solves the problems of numerical precision of the counterterm formulated renormalization. In the two-loop 2PI approximation the equivalence of the new method and the procedure formulated with counterterms is shown, both analytically and numerically. For the counterterm method also a new algorithm is developed, which accelerates the numerical convergence. In the U(N)xU(N) model, an approximate solution of the field equations in the large-N limit is found in the broken phase, for a condensate proportional to the unit matrix. The approximation assumes the presence of a mass-hierarchy between the scalar and pseudoscalar fields. The validity of the latter assumption is investigated in the whole parameter space numerically. The stability of the solution against a more general condensate is checked. It is shown that, there exists a region of the parameter space, where the condensate corresponding to the "8" direction of the SU(3) classification can arise spontaneously. This solution is found to be metastable, but could transform into the true ground state, when a moderate external source is applied along the "8" direction.},

Beyond CP-violating decays we include also those scattering processes which are tightly related to the decays in a consistent approximation of fourth order in the Yukawa couplings. It is demonstrated explicitly how the S-matrix elements for the scattering processes in the conventional approach are related to two- and three-loop contributions to the effective action. We derive effective decay and scattering amplitudes taking medium corrections and thermal masses into account. In this context we also investigate CP-violating Higgs decay within the same formalism. From the kinetic equations we derive rate equations for the lepton asymmetry improved in that they include quantum-statistical effects and medium corrections to the quasiparticle properties.},

  abstract      = {Most of the known models describing the fundamental interactions have a gauge freedom. In the standard path integral, it is necessary to "fix the gauge" in order to avoid integrating over unphysical degrees of freedom. Gauge independence might then become a tricky issue, especially when the structure of the gauge symmetries is intricate. In the modern approach to this question, it is BRST invariance that effectively implements gauge invariance. This set of lectures briefly reviews some key ideas underlying the BRST-antifield formalism, which yields a systematic procedure to path-integrate any type of gauge system, while (usually) manifestly preserving spacetime covariance. The quantized theory possesses a global invariance under the so-called BRST transformation, which is nilpotent of order two. The cohomology of the BRST differential is the central element that controls the physics. Its relationship with the observables is sketched and explained. How anomalies appear in the "quantum master equation" of the antifield formalism is also discussed. These notes are based on lectures given by MH at the 10th Saalburg Summer School on Modern Theoretical Methods from the 30th of August to the 10th of September, 2004 in Wolfersdorf, Germany and were prepared by AF and AM. The exercises which were discussed at the school are also included.},

When calculating the flavour-mixing correlations, we account for the effects of Yukawa as well as of gauge interactions. We compare the freeze-out asymmetry from lepton-doublet mixing to the standard contributions from the mixing and direct decays of right-handed neutrinos. The asymmetry from lepton mixing is considerably large when the mass ratio between the right-handed neutrinos is of order of a few, while it becomes Maxwell-suppressed for larger hierarchies. For an intermediate range between the case of degenerate right-handed neutrinos (resonant Leptogenesis) and the hierarchical case, lepton mixing can yield the main contribution to the lepton asymmetry.},

Using the Closed-Time-Path approach, we demonstrate that the perturbatively obtained inclusive rate is finite. For this purpose, we show that soft, collinear and Bose divergences cancel when adding the tree-level rates from 1<->3 and 2<->2 processes to vertex and wave-function corrections to 1<->2 processes. These results hold for a general momentum of the sterile neutrino with respect to the plasma frame. Moreover, they do not rely on non-relativistic approximations, such that the full quantum-statistical effects are accounted for to the given order in perturbation theory. While the neutrino production rate is of relevance for Leptogenesis, the proposed methods may as well be suitable for application to a more general class of relativistic transport phenomena.},

These values apply to the Standard Model with a Higgs-boson mass of 125 GeV. The dependence of the numerical coefficient on the temperature T is due to the renormalisation group running. The leading linear and logarithmic dependencies of the flavour relaxation rate on the gauge and top-quark couplings are extracted, such that the results presented in this work can readily be applied to extensions of the Standard Model. We also derive the production rate of light (compared to the temperature) sterile right-handed neutrinos, a calculation that relies on the same methods. We confirm most details of earlier results, but find a substantially larger contribution from the t-channel exchange of fermions.},

We show that despite this fact, there is a finite time range during which a local description is accurate. This requires the theory to be (effectively) weakly coupled.

In particular, starting from a pure quantum state, we observe the loss of putity/coherence and, on longer time scales, thermalization of the reduced density matrix.

The maximum temperature in the radiation-dominated era, which we will refer to as the reheat temperature, may have been as low as 0.7 MeV.

We show that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) may be produced even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the freeze-out temperature of the WIMP, and that the dependence of the present abundance on the mass and the annihilation cross section of the WIMP differs drastically from familiar results. We revisit predictions of the relic abundance and resulting model constraints of supersymmetric dark matter, axions, massive neutrinos, and other dark matter candidates, nucleosynthesis constraints on decaying particles, and leptogenesis by decay of superheavy particles. We find that the allowed parameter space of supersymmetric models is altered, removing the usual bounds on the mass spectrum; the cosmological bound on massive neutrinos is drastically changed, ruling out Dirac (Majorana) neutrino masses \$m\_\backslash nu\$ only in the range 33 keV \$\backslash simlt m\_\backslash nu\backslash simlt\$ 6 (5) MeV, which is significantly smaller from the the standard disallowed range 94 eV \$\backslash simlt m\_\backslash nu\backslash simlt\$ 2 GeV (this implies that massive neutrinos may still play the role of either warm or cold dark matter); the cosmological upper bound on the Peccei-Quinn scale may be significantly increased to \$ 10\^{}\{16\}\$GeV from the usually cited limit of about \$10\^{}\{12\}\$GeV; and that efficient out-of-equilibrium GUT baryogenesis and/or leptogenesis can take place even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the mass of the decaying superheavy particle.},

Quite remarkably, if sterile neutrino masses are well below the electroweak scale, this modification --- Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (nuMSM) --- can be tested experimentally. We discuss a new experiment on search for decays of GeV-scale sterile neutrinos, which in the framework of the nuMSM are responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry generation and for the active neutrino masses. If lighter than 2 GeV, these particles can be produced in decays of charm mesons generated by high energy protons in a target of a proton beam-dump experiment, and subsequently decay into light SM particles. In order to fully explore this sector of the nuMSM, the new experiment requires data obtained with at least 10\^{}\{20\} incident protons on target (achievable at CERN SPS in the future), and a big volume detector constructed from a large amount of identical single modules, with a total sterile neutrino decay length of few kilometers. The preliminary feasibility study for the proposed experiment shows that it has sensitivity which may either lead to the discovery of new particles below the Fermi scale --- right-handed partners of neutrinos --- or rule out see-saw sterile neutrinos with masses below 2 GeV.},

As a toy model we couple a free scalar boson quantum field to an exemplaric heat bath with some given temperature T. It will be shown in detail that the emerging transport equations have to be understood as the ensemble average over stochastic equations of Langevin type. This corresponds to the equivalence of the influence functional approach by Feynman and Vernon and the CTP technique. The former, however, gives a more intuitive physical picture. In particular the physical role of (quantum) noise and the connection of its correlation kernel to the Kadanoff-Baym equations will be discussed. The inherent presence of noise and dissipation related by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem guarantees that the modes or particles become thermally populated on average in the long-time limit. For long wavelength modes with momenta much less than the temperature the emerging wave equation do behave nearly as classical. On the other hand, a kinetic transport description can be obtained in the semi-classical particle regime. Including fluctuations, its form resembles that of a phenomenological Boltzmann-Langevin description. However, we will point out some severe discrepancies in comparison to the Boltzmann- Langevin scheme. As a further byproduct we also note how the occurrence of so called pinch singularities is circumvented by a clear physical necessity of damping within the one-particle propagator.},

In contrast with previous attempts to make the EWPT strongly first-order as required by electroweak baryogenesis, we do not rely on large one-loop thermally generated cubic Higgs interactions. Instead, we augment the Standard Model (SM) effective theory with a dimension-six Higgs operator. This addition enables a strong first-order phase transition to develop even with a Higgs boson mass well above the current direct limit of 114 GeV. The phi\^{}6 term can be generated for instance by strong dynamics at the TeV scale or by integrating out heavy particles like an additional singlet scalar field. We discuss conditions to comply with electroweak precision constraints, and point out how future experimental measurements of the Higgs self couplings could test the idea.},

A new model based on the three body decays of right-handed neutrinos is proposed. It naturally allows both leptogenesis and neutrino mass generation at low scale. Also discussed is the possibility of inducing leptogenesis at low scale in existing neutrino mass models: Fukugita-Yanagida model, Higgs triplet model, Zee model and models with R-parity violation.},

The kinetic energy of the fluid is in the form of compression waves: the main source of the GWs after a phase transition is therefore the sound the bubbles make.},

However, the hot and dense medium and, potentially, the expansion of the universe can affect the collision terms and hence the generated asymmetry. In this paper we derive the Boltzmann equation in the curved space-time from (first-principle) Kadanoff-Baym equations. As one expects from general considerations, the derived equations are covariant generalizations of the corresponding equations in Minkowski space-time. We find that, after the necessary approximations have been performed, only the left-hand side of the Boltzmann equation depends on the space-time metric. The amplitudes in the collision term on the right--hand side are independent of the metric, which justifies earlier calculations where this has been assumed implicitly. At tree level, the matrix elements coincide with those computed in vacuum. However, the loop contributions involve additional integrals over the the distribution function.},

On the other hand, the addition of a gauge singlet scalar to the Standard Model yields a thermal dark matter candidate through interactions between the Higgs boson and the gauge singlet scalar. By imposing a \$Z\_2\$ symmetry on the gauge singlet scalar and one of the gauge singlet fermions, we can have viable dark matter candidates and new interactions coupling the \$Z\_2\$-odd scalar to the \$Z\_2\$-odd fermion, which can lower the leptogenesis scale (and the reheating temperature) to \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}\$(TeV).},

  abstract      = {Extensions of the Standard Model are being considered as viable settings for a first-order electroweak phase transition which satisfy Sakharov's three conditions for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These extensions provide a sufficiently strong phase transition and remove the main obstacles which appear in the context of the Standard Model: A far-too-high lower bound on the Higgs mass, immediate wipeout of the newly-created baryon asymmetry, and insufficient CP violation. We describe the Universe hydrodynamically as a fluid coupled to the Higgs field via a phenomenological friction term, and study the time evolution of bubbles nucleated during the phase transition. We express the friction term in the hydrodynamic equations in terms of the particle content of the model, calibrate the friction on the basis of existing calculations for the Standard Model, and produce predictions for the velocity of the expanding bubble wall in the stationary regime. This way we develop a very efficient approach to compute bubble velocities. As an example, we apply our formalism to the first-order phase transition of a dimension-6 extension of the Standard Model which, within the present bounds on the Higgs mass, can reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Depending on the strength of the phase transition, the wall velocity varies from about 0.3 to approaching the speed of light. Our method can easily be adapted to compute wall velocities in other interesting extensions of the Standard Model.},

We show how to characterize renormalizability by an appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for a large momentum cutoff. Renormalized parameters are introduced to control the asymptotic behavior. In part II (sects. 5--9), we introduce two formalisms to incorporate symmetry: one by imposing the Ward-Takahashi identity, and another by imposing the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity via sources that generate symmetry transformations. We apply the two formalisms to concrete models such as QED, YM theories, and the Wess-Zumino model in four dimensions, and the O(N) non-linear sigma model in two dimensions. We end this part with calculations of the abelian axial and chiral anomalies. In part III (sects. 10,11), we overview the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism adapted to the Wilson action of a bare theory with a UV cutoff. We provide a few appendices to give details and extensions that can be omitted for the understanding of the main text. The last appendix is a quick summary for the reader's convenience.},

The aims are threefold: (i) to explain the fundamentals of nonequilibrium quantum field theory as simple as possible on the basis of the knowledge of the equilibrium counterpart; (ii) to elucidate the hierarchy in describing nonequilibrium systems from Dyson's equation on the Keldysh contour to the Navier-Stokes equation in fluid mechanics via quantum transport equations and the Boltzmann equation; (iii) to derive an expression of nonequilibrium entropy that evolves with time. In stage (i), we introduce nonequilibrium Green's function and the self-energy uniquely on the round-trip Keldysh contour, thereby avoiding possible confusions that may arise from defining multiple Green's functions at the very beginning. We try to present the Feynman rules for the perturbation expansion as simple as possible. In particular, we focus on the self-consistent perturbation expansion with the Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic functional, i.e., Baym's Phi-derivable approximation, which has a crucial property for nonequilibrium systems of obeying various conservation laws automatically. We also show how the two-particle correlations can be calculated within the Phi-derivable approximation, i.e., an issue of how to handle the "Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvons (BBGKY) hierarchy".},

We solve for the propagator of the system field, where we include the self-energy corrections due to the interaction with the environment field. In this paper, we consider an environment in the vacuum state (T=0). We show that neglecting inaccessible non-Gaussian correlators increases the entropy of the system as perceived by the observer. Moreover, we consider the effect of a changing mass of the system field in the adiabatic regime, and we find that at late times no additional entropy has been generated.},

Finally, by including hydrodynamic deflagration effects and solving the Higgs equations of motion in the fluid, we determine velocity and thickness of the bubble walls. Our findings are compared with phenomenological models of wall velocities.

Within some ultraviolet uncertainties, the finding applies to MSSM with a Higgs mass m\_h approximately 126 GeV and shows that the parameter region useful for electroweak baryogenesis is enlarged. In particular (even though only dedicated analyses can quantify the issue), the tension between LHC constraints after the 7 TeV and 8 TeV runs and frameworks where the electroweak phase transition is driven by light stops, seems to be relaxed.},

Several of the formation mechanisms occur when bubbles collide and lose their spherical symmetry. However, spherical bubbles are often considered in the literature, in particular for the calculation of gravitational waves. We study the steady state motion of bubble walls for different bubble symmetries. Using the bag equation of state, we discuss the propagation of phase transition fronts as detonations and subsonic or supersonic deflagrations. We consider the cases of spherical, cylindrical and planar walls, and compare the energy transferred to bulk motions of the relativistic fluid. We find that the different wall geometries give similar perturbations of the plasma. For the case of planar walls, we obtain analytical expressions for the kinetic energy in the bulk motions. As an application, we discuss the generation of gravitational waves.},

Many things happened during the 15 years since the time when it was written. In particular, we have learned a lot about the high temperature behavior in the electroweak theory and about baryogenesis. A discovery of the acceleration of the universe has changed the way we are thinking about the problem of the vacuum energy: Instead of trying to explain why it is zero, we are trying to understand why it is anomalously small. Recent cosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost exactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many new versions of this theory have been developed, including hybrid inflation and inflationary models based on string theory. There was a substantial progress in the theory of reheating of the universe after inflation, and in the theory of eternal inflation. It's clear, therefore, that some parts of the book should be updated, which I might do sometimes in the future. I hope, however, that this book may be of some interest even in its original form. I am using it in my lectures on inflationary cosmology at Stanford, supplementing it with the discussion of the subjects mentioned above. I would suggest to read this book in parallel with the book by Liddle and Lyth "Cosmological Inflation and Large Scale Structure,'' with the book by Mukhanov "Physical Foundations of Cosmology,'' to be published soon, and with my review article hep-th/0503195, which contains a discussion of some (but certainly not all) of the recent developments in inflationary theory.},

We propose a new baryogenesis mechanism - "Electroweak Beautygenesis" - explicitly showing that these two CP-violating phenomena can be sourced by a common CP-phase. As an illustration, we work in the Two-Higgs-Doublet model. Because the relevant CP-phase is flavor off-diagonal, this mechanism is less severely constrained by null results of electric dipole moment searches than other scenarios. We show how measurements of flavor observables by the D0, CDF, and LHCb collaborations test this scenario.},

  abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers dealing with many-particle systems from a unified, nonperturbative point of view. It contains derivations and discussions of various field-theoretical techniques which will be applied in subsequent papers, In a short introduction the general method of approach is summarized, and its relationship to other field-theoretic problems indicated. In the second section the macroscopic properties of the spectra of many-particle systems are described. Asymptotic evaluations are performed which characterize these macroscopic features in terms of intensive parameters, and the relationship of these parameters to thermo- dynamics is discussed. The special characteristics of the ground state are shown to follow as a limiting case of the asymptotic evaluations. The third section is devoted to the time-dependent field correlation functions, or Green's functions, which describe the microscopic behavior of a multiparticle system. These func- tions are defined, and related to intensive macroscopic variables when the energy and number of particles are large. Spectral repre- sentations and other properties of various one-particle Green's functions are derived. In the fourth section the treatment of non- equilibrium processes is considered. As a particular example, the electromagnetic properties of a system are expressed in ternis of the special two-particle Green's function which describes current correlation. The discussion yields specifically a Quctuation-dis- sipation theorem, a sum rule for conductivity, and certain disper- sion relations. The fifth section deals with the differential equa- tions which determine the Green's functions. The boundary conditions that characterize the Green's function equations are exhibited without reference to adiabatic decoupling. A niethod for solving the equations approximately, by treating the corre- lations among successively larger numbers of particles, is con- sidered. The first approximation in this sequence is shown to yield a generalized Hartree-like equation. A related, but rigorous, identity for the single-particle Green s function is then derived. A second approximation, which takes certain two-particle corre- lations into account, is shown to produce various additional e8ects: The interaction between particles is altered in a manner characterized by the intensive macroscopic parameters, and the modification and spread of the energy-momentum relation come into play. In the final section compact formal expressions for the Green*s functions and other physical quantities are derived. Alternative equations and systematic approximations for the Green's functions are obtained.},

  abstract      = {In cosmological first-order phase transitions, the microscopic interaction of the phase transition fronts with non-equilibrium plasma particles manifests itself macroscopically as friction forces. In general, it is a nontrivial problem to compute these forces, and only two limits have been studied, namely, that of very slow walls and, more recently, ultra-relativistic walls which run away. In this paper we consider ultra-relativistic velocities and show that stationary solutions still exist when the parameters allow the existence of runaway walls. Hence, we discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for the fronts to actually run away. We also propose a phenomenological model for the friction, which interpolates between the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic values. Thus, the friction depends on two friction coefficients which can be calculated for specific models. We then study the velocity of phase transition fronts as a function of the friction parameters, the thermodynamic parameters, and the amount of supercooling.},

  abstract      = {Earlier studies of the influence of Dark Matter keV sterile neutrinos on neutrino-less double beta decay concluded that there is no significant modification of the decay rate. These studies have focused only on a mass of the keV sterile neutrino above 2 and 4 keV, respectively, as motivated by certain production mechanisms. On the other hand, alternative production mechanisms have been proposed, which relax the lower limit for the mass, and new experimental/observational data is available, too. For this reason, an updated study is timely and worthwhile. We focus on the most recent data, i.e., the newest Chandra and XMM-Newton observational bounds on the X-ray line originating from radiative keV sterile neutrino decay, as well as the new measurement of the previously unknown leptonic mixing angle \$\backslash theta\_\{13\}\$ by the Daya Bay, RENO, and Double Chooz experiments. We find that, while the previous works had been too short-sighted, the new observational bounds do indeed render any influences of keV sterile neutrinos on neutrino-less double beta decay small. This conclusion even holds in case not all the Dark Matter is made up of keV sterile neutrinos. The bounds are so powerful that they strongly constrain form-dominant neutrino mixing, which is of interest for models of keV sterile neutrinos.},

Our approach to non-equilibrium dynamics yields time-dependent diagrammatic perturbation series that are free of pinch singularities, without the need to resort to quasi-particle approximation or effective resummations of finite widths. In our formalism, the avoidance of pinch singularities is a consequence of the consistent inclusion of finite-time effects and the proper consideration of the time of observation. After introducing a physically meaningful definition of particle number densities, we derive master time evolution equations for statistical distribution functions, which are valid to all orders in perturbation theory. The resulting equations do not rely upon a gradient expansion of Wigner transforms or involve any separation of time scales. To illustrate the key features of our formalism, we study out-of-equilibrium decay dynamics of unstable particles in a simple scalar model. In particular, we show how finite-time effects remove the pinch singularities and lead to violation of energy conservation at early times, giving rise to otherwise kinematically forbidden processes. The non-Markovian nature of the memory effects as predicted in our formalism is explicitly demonstrated.},

We treat these with Boltzmann equations in a fluid approximation. This approximation is reasonable for the top quarks and the light species while it underestimates the friction from the infrared \$W\$ bosons and Higgs particles. We use the two-loop finite temperature effective potential and find a subsonic bubble wall for the whole range of Higgs masses \$0<m\_H<90\$GeV. The result is weakly dependent on \$m\_H\$: the wall velocity \$v\_w\$ falls in the range \$0.36<v\_w<0.44\$, while the wall thickness is in the range \$29> L T > 23 \$. The wall is thicker than the phase equilibrium value because out of equilibrium particles exert more friction on the back than on the base of a moving wall. We also consider the effect of an infrared gauge condensate which may exist in the symmetric phase; modelling it simplemindedly, we find that the wall may become supersonic, but not ultrarelativistic.},

We discuss the accuracy of this approach and conclude that, for quantities whose determination is dominated by the infrared, the classical method should be correct up to parametrically suppressed (ie O(alpha)) corrections. For a Higgs self-coupling which at tree level corresponds to m\_H \~{} 50 GeV, we determine the jump in the order parameter to be delta phi = 1.5 gT, the surface tension to be sigma = 0.07 g\^{}4 T\^{}3, and the friction coefficient on the moving bubble wall due to infrared bosons to be $\backslash$eta = P/v\_w = 0.03 $\backslash$pm .004 g\^{}6 T\^{}4. We also investigate the response of Chern-Simons number to a spatially uniform chemical potential and find that it falls off a short distance inside the bubble wall, both in equilibrium and below the equilibrium temperature.},

  abstract      = {We propose a novel scenario to explain the observed cosmological asymmetry between matter and antimatter, based on nonperturbative QCD physics. This scenario relies on a mechanism of separation of quarks and antiquarks in two coexisting phases at the end of the cosmological QCD phase transition: ordinary hadrons (and antihadrons), along with massive lumps (and antilumps) of novel color superconducting phase. The latter would serve as the cosmological cold dark matter. In certain conditions the separation of charge is C and CP asymmetric and can leave a net excess of hadrons over antihadrons in the conventional phase, even if the visible universe is globally baryon symmetric \$B = 0\$. In this case an equal, but negative, overall baryon charge must be hidden in the lumps of novel phase. Due to the small volume occupied by these dense lumps/antilumps of color superconducting phase and the specific features of their interaction with "normal" matter in hadronic phase, this scenario does not contradict the current phenomenological constrains on presence of antimatter in the visible universe. Moreover, in this scenario the observed cosmological ratio \$\backslash Omega\_\{DM\}\backslash sim\backslash Omega\_\{B\}\$ within an order of magnitude finds a natural explanation, as both contributions to \$\backslash Omega\$ originated from the same physics during the QCD phase transition. The baryon to entropy ratio \$n\_\{B\}/n\_\{\backslash gamma\}\backslash sim 10\^{}\{-10\}\$ would also be a natural outcome, fixed by the temperature \$T\_f \backslash simlt T\_\{QCD\}\$ at which the separation of phases is completed.},

These models offer a number of testable phenomenological signatures for low-energy experiments and future high-energy colliders. Our study extends previous analyses of the relevant network of Boltzmann equations, consistently taking into account effects from out of equilibrium sphalerons and single lepton flavours. We show that the effects from single lepton flavours become very important in variants of resonant leptogenesis, where the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe is created by lepton-to-baryon conversion of an individual lepton number, for example that of the tau lepton. The predictions of such resonant tau-leptogenesis models for the final baryon asymmetry are almost independent of the initial lepton-number and heavy neutrino abundances. These models accommodate the current neutrino data and have a number of testable phenomenological implications. They contain electroweak-scale heavy Majorana neutrinos with appreciable couplings to electrons and muons, which can be probed at future e+ e- and mu+ mu- high-energy colliders. In particular, resonant tau-leptogenesis models predict sizeable 0$\backslash$nu$\backslash$beta$\backslash$beta decay, as well as e- and mu-number-violating processes, such as mu -> e gamma and mu -> e conversion in nuclei, with rates that are within reach of the experiments proposed by the MEG and MECO collaborations.},

  abstract      = {These introductory notes are about functional renormalization group equations and some of their applications. It is emphasised that the applicability of this method extends well beyond critical systems, it actually provides us a general purpose algorithm to solve strongly coupled quantum field theories. The renormalization group equation of F. Wegner and A. Houghton is shown to resum the loop-expansion. Another version, due to J. Polchinski, is obtained by the method of collective coordinates and can be used for the resummation of the perturbation series. The genuinely non-perturbative evolution equation is obtained in a manner reminiscent of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. Two variants of this scheme are presented where the scale which determines the order of the successive elimination of the modes is extracted from external and internal spaces. The renormalization of composite operators is discussed briefly as an alternative way to arrive at the renormalization group equation. The scaling laws and fixed points are considered from local and global points of view. Instability induced renormalization and new scaling laws are shown to occur in the symmetry broken phase of the scalar theory. The flattening of the effective potential of a compact variable is demonstrated in case of the sine-Gordon model. Finally, a manifestly gauge invariant evolution equation is given for QED.},

Starting from the one-loop Schwinger-Dyson equations for fermions coupled to bosons, we present a derivation of the relevant kinetic equations in the on-shell and gradient approximations, relevant for the thick wall baryogenesis regime. We then discuss the CP-violating source from the semiclassical force in the flow term, and compare it with the source arising in the collision term of the kinetic equation. Finally, we summarize the results concerning the chargino mediated baryogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.},

Bubble nucleation by thermal tunneling, and the subsequent development of the phase transition is described in some detail. Some attention is also devoted to the breakdown of the perturbative expansion and the infrared problem in the finite temperature field theory. Finally the application to baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition is done in the Standard Model and in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

During the early universe, for T>TeV, part of the symmetry is restored, due to finite temperature contributions, and the RH neutrinos remain massless and can be produced in thermal equilibrium even at temperatures well below the most conservative gravitino bounds. Below this temperature the phase transition occurs and they become massive, decaying out of equilibrium and producing the necessary lepton asymmetry. Unless the symmetry is broken explicitly by Planck-suppressed terms, the domain walls generated by the symmetry breaking survive till the quark-hadron phase transition, where they disappear due to a small energy splitting between different vacua caused by the QCD anomaly.},

  abstract      = {Various aspects of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) are explored, starting with a review of the concepts underpinning the framework and the circumstances under which it is expected to be useful. A particular emphasis is placed on the intuitive picture provided for both renormalization in quantum field theory and universality associated with second order phase transitions. A qualitative discussion of triviality, asymptotic freedom and asymptotic safety is presented. Focusing on scalar field theory, the construction of assorted flow equations is considered using a general approach, whereby different ERGs follow from field redefinitions. It is recalled that Polchinski's equation can be cast as a heat equation, which provides intuition and computational techniques for what follows. The analysis of properties of exact solutions to flow equations includes a proof that the spectrum of the anomalous dimension at critical fixed-points is quantized. Two alternative methods for computing the beta-function in lambda phi\^{}4 theory are considered. For one of these it is found that all explicit dependence on the non-universal differences between a family of ERGs cancels out, exactly. The Wilson-Fisher fixed-point is rediscovered in a rather novel way. The discussion of nonperturbative approximation schemes focuses on the derivative expansion, and includes a refinement of the arguments that, at the lowest order in this approximation, a function can be constructed which decreases monotonically along the flow. A new perspective is provided on the relationship between the renormalizability of the Wilsonian effective action and of correlation functions, following which the construction of manifestly gauge invariant ERGs is sketched, and some new insights are given. Drawing these strands together suggests a new approach to quantum field theory.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the possibility that the hot thermal phase of the early universe is ignited in consequence of the B-L phase transition, which represents the cosmological realization of the spontaneous breaking of the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with B-L, the difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. Prior to the B-L phase transition, the universe experiences a stage of hybrid inflation. Towards the end of inflation, the false vacuum of unbroken B-L decays, which entails tachyonic preheating as well as the production of cosmic strings. The dynamics of the B-L breaking Higgs field and the B-L gauge degrees of freedom, in combination with thermal processes, generate an abundance of heavy (s)neutrinos. These (s)neutrinos decay into radiation, thereby reheating the universe, generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe and setting the stage for the thermal production of gravitinos. We study the B-L phase transition in the full supersymmetric Abelian Higgs model, for which we derive and discuss the Lagrangian in arbitrary and unitary gauge. As for the subsequent reheating process, we formulate the complete set of Boltzmann equations, the solutions of which enable us to give a detailed and time-resolved description of reheating. Assuming the gravitino to be the lightest superparticle (LSP), the requirement of consistency between hybrid inflation, leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter implies relations between neutrino and superparticle masses, in particular a lower bound on the gravitino mass of 10 GeV. Similarly, in the case of very heavy gravitinos, the nonthermal production of pure wino or higgsino LSPs in heavy gravitino decays can account for the observed amount of dark matter, while simultaneously fulfilling the constraints imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis and leptogenesis.},

We elucidate the issue of CP-violation in the model and define the phase relevant for baryogenesis. We clarify the question of quantum-mechanical coherence, essential for the lepton asymmetry generation in singlet fermion oscillations and compute the relevant damping rates. The range of masses and couplings of singlet leptons which can lead to successful baryogenesis is determined. The conditions which ensure survival of primordial (existing above the electroweak temperatures) asymmetries in different leptonic numbers are analysed. We address the question whether CP-violating reactions with lepton number non-conservation can produce leptonic asymmetry \{$\backslash$em below\} the sphaleron freeze-out temperature. This asymmetry, if created, leads to resonant production of dark matter sterile neutrinos. We show that the requirement that a significant lepton asymmetry be produced puts stringent constraints on the properties of a pair of nearly degenerate singlet fermions, which can be tested in accelerator experiments. In this region of parameters the \$\backslash nu\$MSM provides a common mechanism for production of baryonic matter and dark matter in the universe. We analyse different fine-tunings of the model and discuss possible symmetries of the \$\backslash nu\$MSM Lagrangian that can lead to them.},

Supposing that this is indeed the case and assuming that there are no intermediate energy scales between the Fermi and Planck scales we address the question of whether the mass of the Higgs boson \$m\_H\$ can be predicted. For a positive gravity induced anomalous dimension \$A\_\backslash lambda>0\$ the running of the quartic scalar self interaction \$\backslash lambda\$ at scales beyond the Planck mass is determined by a fixed point at zero. This results in \$m\_H=m\_\{\backslash rm min\}=126\$ GeV, with only a few GeV uncertainty. This prediction is independent of the details of the short distance running and holds for a wide class of extensions of the SM as well. For \$A\_\backslash lambda <0\$ one finds \$m\_H\$ in the interval \$m\_\{\backslash rm min\}< m\_H < m\_\{\backslash rm max\}\backslash simeq 174\$ GeV, now sensitive to \$A\_\backslash lambda\$ and other properties of the short distance running.

The knowledge of the effective dynamics on such spatial and time scales is crucial for the understanding and quantitative calculation of the baryon number violation rate at high temperatures in the electroweak theory. The Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the diffusive motion of soft components of the gauge field in the space of field configurations, is shown to be gauge-invariant and consistent with the known thermodynamics of soft gauge modes. We discuss the ways the Fokker-Planck equation can be made useful for numerical simulations of long-distance dynamics of hot gauge theories.},

The status of lattice simulations of the transition from a high temperature quark-gluon plasma to confined hadronic matter with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is also briefly reviewed. The various changes of the free energy density in cosmological phase transitions reinforce the cosmological constant problem.

  abstract      = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega\_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95\% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

The main focus is on the linear relaxation of mean fields and quantum kinetics in nonequilibrium multiparticle quantum systems with potential applications to ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, cosmological phase transitions and condensed matter systems. We first study the damping of fermion mean fields in a fermion-scalar plasma with a view towards understanding baryon transport phenomena during electroweak baryogenesis. Secondly, we apply and extend the renormalization group method to study nonequilibrium dynamics with the goals of constructing a quantum kinetic description that goes beyond usual Boltzmann kinetics and understanding anomalous relaxation associated with infrared phenomena. The final part of this thesis presents a real-time kinetic analysis of direct photon production from a quark-gluon plasma created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We show that the direct photon yield is significantly enhanced by the lowest order energy-nonconserving processes originated in the transient lifetime of the quark-gluon plasma.},

  abstract = {This work is about a formulation of abelian gauge theories out-of-equilibrium. In contrast to thermal equilibrium, systems out-of-equilibrium are not constant in time, and the interesting questions in such systems refer to time evolution problems. After a short introduction to quantum electrodynamics (QED), the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action is introduced as an essential technique for the study of quantum field theories out-of-equilibrium. The equations of motion (EOMs) for the propagators of the theory are then derived from it. It follows a discussion of the physical degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the theory, in particular with respect to the photons, since in covariant formulations of gauge theories unphysical DOFs are necessarily contained. After that the Eoms for the photon propagator are examined more closely. It turns out that they are structurally complicated, and a reformulation of the equations is presented which for the untruncated theory leads to an essential structural simplification of the EOMs. After providing the initial conditions which are necessary in order to solve the EOMs, the free photon EOMs are solved with the help of the reformulated equations. It turns out that the solutions diverge in time, i.e. they are secular. This is a manifestation of the fact that gauge theories contain unphysical DOFs. It is reasoned that these secularities exist only in the free case and are therefore "artificial". It is however emphasized that they may not be a problem in principle, but certainly are in practice, in particular for the numerical solution of the EOMs. Further, the origin of the secularities, for which there exists an illustrative explanation, is discussed in more detail. Another characteristic feature of 2PI formulations of gauge theories is the fact that quantities calculated from approximations of the 2PI effective action, which are gauge invariant in the exact theory as well as in an approximated theory at each perturbative order, are not gauge invariant in general. A closely related phenomenon is the fact that the Ward identities, which are relations between correlation functions of different order, are not in general applicable to correlation functions which are calculated from the 2PI effective action. As an example the photon self-energy is presented, which is transverse in the exact theory as well as perturbatively at each order, but not if it is calculated starting from the 2PI effective action. It is shown that both these phenomena are caused by the complex resummation implemented by the 2PI effective action. Finally, a concrete approximation of the 2PI effective action is presented, and the self-energies are derived from it in a form which is suitable for the practical implementation on a computer. Some results are shown which have been obtained by the numerical solution of the 2PI EOMs.},

  abstract      = {We consider a symmetric scalar theory with quartic coupling in 4-dimensions and compare the standard 2PI calculation with a modified version which uses a functional renormalization group method. The set of integral differential equations that are obtained from the exact renormalization group method truncate naturally, without the introduction of additional approximations. The results of the two methods agree well, which shows that the exact renormalization group can be used at the level of the 2PI effective action to obtain finite results without the use of counter-terms. The method therefore offers a promising starting point to study the renormalization of higher order \$n\$PI theories.},
