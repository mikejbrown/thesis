  abstract      = {In this article, we present a concise and self-contained introduction to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics with quantum field theory by considering an ensemble of interacting identical bosons or fermions as an example. Readers are assumed to be familiar with the Matsubara formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics such as Feynman diagrams, the proper self-energy, and Dyson's equation. The aims are threefold: (i) to explain the fundamentals of nonequilibrium quantum field theory as simple as possible on the basis of the knowledge of the equilibrium counterpart; (ii) to elucidate the hierarchy in describing nonequilibrium systems from Dyson's equation on the Keldysh contour to the Navier-Stokes equation in fluid mechanics via quantum transport equations and the Boltzmann equation; (iii) to derive an expression of nonequilibrium entropy that evolves with time. In stage (i), we introduce nonequilibrium Green's function and the self-energy uniquely on the round-trip Keldysh contour, thereby avoiding possible confusions that may arise from defining multiple Green's functions at the very beginning. We try to present the Feynman rules for the perturbation expansion as simple as possible. In particular, we focus on the self-consistent perturbation expansion with the Luttinger-Ward thermodynamic functional, i.e., Baym's Phi-derivable approximation, which has a crucial property for nonequilibrium systems of obeying various conservation laws automatically. We also show how the two-particle correlations can be calculated within the Phi-derivable approximation, i.e., an issue of how to handle the "Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvons (BBGKY) hierarchy".},

  abstract      = {The chiral phase transition is investigated within the framework of thermal field theory using the O(N) linear sigma model as an effective theory. We calculate the thermal effective potential by using the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism of composite operators. The thermal effective potential is calculated for N=4 involving as usual the sigma and the three pions, and in the large-N approximation involving N-1 pion fields. In both cases, the system of the resulting gap equations for the thermal effective masses of the particles has been solved numerically, and we have investigated the evolution of the effective potential. In the N=4 case, there is indication of a first-order phase transition, while in the large N approximation the phase transition appears as second-order. In this analysis, we have ignored quantum fluctuations and have used the imaginary time formalism for calculations. We have extended our calculation in order to include the full effect of two loops in the calculation of the effective potential. In this case, the effective masses are momentum dependent. In order to perform the calculations, we found the real time formalism to be convenient. We have calculated the effective masses of pions at the low-temperature phase and we found a quadratic dependence on temperature, in contrast to the Hartree case, where the mass is proportional to temperature. The sigma mass was investigated in the presence of massive pions, and we found a small deviation compared to the Hartree case. In all cases, the system approaches the behaviour of the ideal gas at the high temperature limit.},

For a Higgs self-coupling which at tree level corresponds to m\_H \~{} 50 GeV, we determine the jump in the order parameter to be delta phi = 1.5 gT, the surface tension to be sigma = 0.07 g\^{}4 T\^{}3, and the friction coefficient on the moving bubble wall due to infrared bosons to be $\backslash$eta = P/v\_w = 0.03 $\backslash$pm .004 g\^{}6 T\^{}4.

  abstract      = {Extensions of the Standard Model are being considered as viable settings for a first-order electroweak phase transition which satisfy Sakharov's three conditions for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These extensions provide a sufficiently strong phase transition and remove the main obstacles which appear in the context of the Standard Model: A far-too-high lower bound on the Higgs mass, immediate wipeout of the newly-created baryon asymmetry, and insufficient CP violation. We describe the Universe hydrodynamically as a fluid coupled to the Higgs field via a phenomenological friction term, and study the time evolution of bubbles nucleated during the phase transition. We express the friction term in the hydrodynamic equations in terms of the particle content of the model, calibrate the friction on the basis of existing calculations for the Standard Model, and produce predictions for the velocity of the expanding bubble wall in the stationary regime. This way we develop a very efficient approach to compute bubble velocities. As an example, we apply our formalism to the first-order phase transition of a dimension-6 extension of the Standard Model which, within the present bounds on the Higgs mass, can reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Depending on the strength of the phase transition, the wall velocity varies from about 0.3 to approaching the speed of light. Our method can easily be adapted to compute wall velocities in other interesting extensions of the Standard Model.},

We show that in general the solutions of the dynamical equations of motion, derived from approximations of the \$\backslash Phi\$-functional, do not fulfill the Ward-Takahashi identities of the symmetry of the underlying classical action, although the conservation laws for the expectation values of the corresponding Noether currents are fulfilled exactly for the approximation. Further we prove that one can define an effective action functional in terms of the self-consistent propagators which is invariant under the operation of the same symmetry group representation as the classical action. The requirements for this theorem to hold true are the same as for perturbative approximations: The symmetry has to be realized linearly on the fields and it must be free of anomalies, i.e., there should exist a symmetry conserving regularization scheme. In addition, if the theory is renormalizable in Dyson's narrow sense, it can be renormalized with counter terms which do not violate the symmetry.},

One should not forget, however, that the baryonic component presents its own questions for particle cosmology. In the context of cosmology, baryons would have annihilated with their antiparticles in the early universe, leaving a negligible abundance of baryons, in disagreement with that observed. In this general lecture, delivered at the SLAC 2004 Summer Science Institute, I provide an overview of the central issue and the general principles behind candidate models. I also briefly discuss some popular examples of models that are firmly rooted in particle physics.},

  abstract      = {The nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum fields is an initial-value problem, which can be described by Kadanoff-Baym equations. Typically, and in particular when numerical solutions are demanded, these Kadanoff-Baym equations are restricted to Gaussian initial states. However, physical initial states are non-Gaussian correlated initial states. In particular, renormalizability requires the initial state to feature n-point correlations that asymptotically agree with the vacuum correlations at short distances. In order to identify physical nonequilibrium initial states, it is therefore a precondition to describe the vacuum correlations of the interacting theory within the nonequilibrium framework. In this paper, Kadanoff-Baym equations for non-Gaussian correlated initial states describing vacuum and thermal equilibrium are derived from the 2PI effective action. A diagrammatic method for the explicit construction of vacuum and thermal initial correlations from the 2PI effective action is provided. We present numerical solutions of Kadanoff-Baym equations for a real scalar Phi\^{}4 quantum field theory which take the thermal initial 4-point correlation as the leading non-Gaussian correction into account. We find that this minimal non-Gaussian initial condition yields an approximation to the complete equilibrium initial state that is quantitatively and qualitatively significantly improved as compared to Gaussian initial states.},

  abstract      = {This is the LaTeX version of my book "Particle Physics and Inflationary Cosmology'' (Harwood, Chur, Switzerland, 1990). I decided to put it to hep-th, to make it easily available. Many things happened during the 15 years since the time when it was written. In particular, we have learned a lot about the high temperature behavior in the electroweak theory and about baryogenesis. A discovery of the acceleration of the universe has changed the way we are thinking about the problem of the vacuum energy: Instead of trying to explain why it is zero, we are trying to understand why it is anomalously small. Recent cosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost exactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many new versions of this theory have been developed, including hybrid inflation and inflationary models based on string theory. There was a substantial progress in the theory of reheating of the universe after inflation, and in the theory of eternal inflation. It's clear, therefore, that some parts of the book should be updated, which I might do sometimes in the future. I hope, however, that this book may be of some interest even in its original form. I am using it in my lectures on inflationary cosmology at Stanford, supplementing it with the discussion of the subjects mentioned above. I would suggest to read this book in parallel with the book by Liddle and Lyth "Cosmological Inflation and Large Scale Structure,'' with the book by Mukhanov "Physical Foundations of Cosmology,'' to be published soon, and with my review article hep-th/0503195, which contains a discussion of some (but certainly not all) of the recent developments in inflationary theory.},

In contrast with previous attempts to make the EWPT strongly first-order as required by electroweak baryogenesis, we do not rely on large one-loop thermally generated cubic Higgs interactions. Instead, we augment the Standard Model (SM) effective theory with a dimension-six Higgs operator. This addition enables a strong first-order phase transition to develop even with a Higgs boson mass well above the current direct limit of 114 GeV. The phi\^{}6 term can be generated for instance by strong dynamics at the TeV scale or by integrating out heavy particles like an additional singlet scalar field. We discuss conditions to comply with electroweak precision constraints, and point out how future experimental measurements of the Higgs self couplings could test the idea.},

This observation threatens the viability of electroweak baryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to or mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these constraints, we propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition and impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as the MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the measurement of a 125 GeV Higgs. Models which rely on tree-level effects from a light singlet are also restricted by invisible decay and mixing constraints. Moreover, we find that the parametric region favored by electroweak baryogenesis often coincides with an enhanced symmetry point with a distinctive phenomenological character. In particular, enhancements arising through an approximate continuous symmetry are phenomenologically disfavored, in contrast with enhancements from discrete symmetries. We also comment on the excess of diphoton events observed by ATLAS and CMS. We note that although Higgs portal models can accommodate both enhanced diphoton decay and a strongly first order electroweak phase transition, the former favors a negative Higgs portal coupling whereas the latter favors a positive one, and therefore these two constraints are at tension with one another.},

  abstract      = {Nonperturbative approximation schemes based on two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective actions provide an important means for our current understanding of (non-)equilibrium quantum field theory. A remarkable property is their renormalizability, since these approximations involve selective summations to infinite perturbative orders. In this paper, we show how to renormalize all n-point functions of the theory, which are given by derivatives of the 2PI-resummed effective action $\Gamma$[$\phi$] for scalar fields $\phi$. This provides a complete description in terms of the generating functional for renormalized proper vertices, which extends previous prescriptions in the literature on the renormalization for 2PI effective actions. The importance of the 2PI-resummed generating functional for proper vertices stems from the fact that the latter respect all symmetry properties of the theory and, in particular, Goldstone's theorem in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is important in view of the application of these techniques to gauge theories, where Ward identities play a crucial role. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In the parameter region considered the transition on the lattice is significantly stronger than indicated by a 2-loop perturbative analysis. Within some ultraviolet uncertainties, the finding applies to MSSM with a Higgs mass m\_h approximately 126 GeV and shows that the parameter region useful for electroweak baryogenesis is enlarged. In particular (even though only dedicated analyses can quantify the issue), the tension between LHC constraints after the 7 TeV and 8 TeV runs and frameworks where the electroweak phase transition is driven by light stops, seems to be relaxed.},

The key is an organizational trick that involves the introduction of a set of fictitious bare vertices that are set to zero at the end of the calculation. Using these fictitious vertices, we prove that the Schwinger-Dyson equations are the same as the equations of motion obtained from the n-particle irreducible effective action, up to the level at which they respect the symmetries of the original theory. This result allows us to obtain the effective action directly from the Schwinger-Dyson equations, which are comparatively easy to calculate. As a check of our method, we reproduce the known results for the n-Loop n-particle irreducible effective action with n = 4 and n = 5. We also use the technique to calculate the 6-Loop 6-particle irreducible effective action.},

  abstract      = {A loop or coupling expansion of a so-called n-particle irreducible (nPI) generating functional provides a well-defined approximation scheme in terms of self-consistently dressed propagators and n-point vertices. A self-consistently complete description determines the functional for arbitrarily high n to a given order in the expansion. We point out an equivalence hierarchy for nPI effective actions, which allows one to obtain a self-consistently complete result in practice. The method is applied to a SU(N) gauge theory with fermions up to four-loop or O(g\^{}6) corrections. For non-equilibrium we discuss the connection to kinetic theory. The leading-order on-shell results in g can be obtained from the three-loop effective action approximation, which already includes in particular all diagrams enhanced by the Landau Pomeranchuk Migdal effect. Furthermore, we compare the effective action approach with Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. By construction, SD equations are expressed in terms of loop diagrams including both classical and dressed vertices, which leads to ambiguities of whether classical or dressed ones should be employed at a given truncation order. We point out that these problems are absent using effective action techniques. We show that a wide class of truncations of SD equations cannot be obtained from the nPI effective action. In turn, our results can be used to resolve SD ambiguities of whether classical or dressed vertices should be employed at a given truncation order.},

The results of the two methods agree well, which shows that the exact renormalization group can be used at the level of the 2PI effective action to obtain finite results without the use of counter-terms.
